17jk2ya,Je suis enseignant secondaire 2. Voici le problème et voici pourquoi on fait la grève,ShowIcy9501,Témoignage,498,0.92,388,"Lever à 6AM. Départ a 7AM. Cours à 8AM. Je suis à 100% de tâche donc trois cours en moyenne par jour. Parfois plus. 

Il y a les récups aussi le midi.

Il y a les réunions. La correction. Je dois monter mes cours, envoyer le tout à la photocophie.

Le soir, je dois répondre aux courriels, faire ce que je n'ai pas eu le temps de faire pendant la journée. Il m'arrive de terminer de travailler à 10h le soir. 

L'école finit à 15h15. je suis chez nous à 16h. Je finis de travailler à 18h si je suis chanceux. 20h la plupart du temps. 

Ça me fait des journées de 10-12 heures. Pas 100% occupé, j'ai des midis et des périodes de libre, mais en gros, je travaille pas mal. J'ai 250 copies qui me restent à corriger d'ici vendredi 4PM, vous pensez que je vais faire ça quand?

Ah oui, les sorties scolaires. Les appels de parents. Les rencontres avec la directions. Les nouveaux plans d'intervention. Les séminaires de perfectionnement. Et puis le nouveau cahier pour l'an prochain à choisir. Ai-je mentionné que j'ai trois cours à monter cette année? Parce que j'enseigne trois niveaux.

Qu'est-ce que je reçois par semaine pour mes efforts?

...

Après impôts, taxes et déductions, je reçois...

**... 550 $.**

That's it. 550 piastres net par semaine.

45,000 $ divisé par 12 mois, 3750 $ brut par mois, 865 $ par semaine. Enlève les déductions (10% RREGOP en passant), pis je dois vivre avec 2200 $ par mois. 

Divise ça par le nombre d'heures de fou que je fais (facilement 50 heures semaine. FACILEMENT) pis ça me fait un gros onze dollars nets d'impot dans mes poches de l'heure.

Je faisais FACILEMENT le double à mon ancienne job avant. FACILEMENT. Pis quand la journée finissait, j'y pensais pas. Pas de courriel paniqué de parents pcq sa fille a fait une crise de panique suivant un examen pis elle a besoin d'aide tu-suite. Pas de direction qui veut te rencontrer demain avant les cours parce qu'un étudiant en intimide un autre. Pas de présentation à faire ou de copies à corriger ou d'essais à lire.

Faque le 2% d'augmentation par année, tu sais où te le calisser... ""Wow, 900$ après impôts de plus par année! Presque $50 par mois de plus dans mes poches!!"" Pendant ce temps la, mon loyer à lui seule monte du même montant, pis je me considère chanceux qu'il monte juste de ça, parce que ailleurs c'est ben pire.

J'aime ma job pis j'aime enseigner mais j'arrive pu. Je pense lâcher. Ya pas une journée que j'ai pas le goût de toute crisser ça là pis retourner à mon ancienne job. Et pis mon ancienne job, c'était de quoi de ben ordinaire, un poste dans un bureau ben ordinaire à 25.50 $ de l'heure. Pis même eux m'offraient plus que 2% d'augmentation par année CALISSE.

1lsyqif,Québécois ont vécu l’enfer,Gold-Technology-4209,Opinion,367,0.92,123,"Je suis musulman fils d’immigrant. J’ai toujours vu les québécois anti religion et pro laïcité. Je me sentais toujours attaqué par ça, que j’étais la cible. C’est vrai je le suis et ma communauté aussi par certains. Cependant, dernièrement je me suis intéressé plus profondément à l’histoire des québécois.

Finalement, au Québec, la religion a écrasé le peuple et l’a réduit au silence pendant 300 ans. Les grands et arrières grands parents ont vécu l’enfer dû à l’église. Et la révolution tranquille c’était une VRAI libération de ce système sordide. 

C’est là que j’ai compris que voir le retour de la religion (islam ou autre) c’est voir l’histoire se répéter.

Oui on demande aux québécois de comprendre les musulmans et d’être ouverts, mais c’est super important que les musulmans et autre religion comprennent cette histoire au Québec! Voir un voile c’est voir l’oppression vécu pendant 300 ans. (Ma mère et ma sœur le portent)

Aussitôt que j’ai compris ce trauma, j’ai plus de compassion et de patience. C’est aux musulmans aussi de rassurer ce peuple que l’histoire ne se répétera pas. Et je vous assure que la majorité des musulmans se sont échappés de ça et ne veulent pas la restaurer ailleurs. Il y a une minorité extrême comme partout.

C'est pas gratuit, on paye pour. La différence c'est qu'icite on paye pour pis après on reçoit un service de marde et on se fait dire qu'on devrait remercier le service de marde qu'on paye toute notre vie. 

Je ne veux pas faire d'arguments sur la privatisation ou le système qu'on a présentement, c'est comme le problème qui survient a chaque fois qu'on chiale sur le système. Le monde se mette en tête que si tu chiales c'est parce que tu veux du changement, pis oui, en parti, mais le changement que je veux c'est pas de tout décrisser par terre et reconstruire, osti j'veux juste un médecin qui prend 2 minutes pour donner une vraie réponse au lieu du niaisage actuel. 

Mise en context: Ma femme a donner naissance a nos jumeaux récemment, césarienne malheureusement. Depuis, on est constamment a l'hopital car elle fait des infections ou elle a des douleurs qu'ils n'arrivent pas a expliquer. 

Le médecin de famille? Pas fucking possible de rencontrer. La job de la secrétaire c'est de raccrocher le plus rapidement possible, pas de prendre des rendez-vous. Je me présente en personne pour me faire dire que madame doit être là pour prendre un rendez-vous. On y va ensemble on se fait dire qu'elle prend juste les rendez-vous par téléphone. 

On commence a s'impatienté parce qu'elle nous niaise clairement, elle pointe l'affiche que les échanges doivent être fait dans le respect pendant qu'elle nous traite pratiquement de cave. 

Ok, fuck it, on va a l'urgence. 

Première fois, le médecin dit que c'est juste des contractions ralentis. Ma femme leur dit qu'elle sait c'est quoi une contraction, mais que là ça brûle pis elle fait de la fièvre. Nope, retourner a la maison. 

Deuxième fois, ils l'admettent car elle fait de la fièvre pis ça ne fait pas de caliss de bon sens. Après deux jours ils lui donnent une prescription de pilules pis y check s'ils auraient pas oublié un peu de placenta a l'intérieur. 

Après une semaine, pu de pilule, l'infection recommence. 

On retourne, le doc dit que ça fait pas de bon sens, il comprend pas pourquoi y'on fait ça. Donne une autre pilule pète pis répète sont en bateau...

On rencontre une autre doc (rendez vous normal pour les enfants) on en profite pour mentionner l'infection. La doc est complètement abasourdit, elle ne comprend pas qu'après autant de temps sa césarienne cause encore des problèmes. Elle dit qu'elle va en parler avec son collègue et nous céduler un rendez-vous d'urgence. 

...

5 jours plus tard on appel et la doc est en vacance. NON MAIS TABARNAK. 

Faque ce matin on va au sans rendez-vous encore avec nos des bébés tous neufs entouré d'monde qui tousse pis qui n'ont toujours pas compris c'est quoi du purell. Haha, bonne blague le purell, même l'hôpital le remplis pu tabarnak.

Mais Lia Thomas voulait absolument compétionner contre des femmes aux Jeux Olympiques, en affirmant qu'une interdiction en ce sens serait ""discriminatoire à son égard en violation de la Charte olympique, de la constitution de World Aquatics et de la loi suisse"".

Sauf que le Tribunal arbitral du sport (TAS) en a décidé autrement. Lia Thomas ne pourra donc plus nager avec les femmes. World Aquatics s'est réjoui de cette décision en déclarant que cela ""constitue selon nous une avancée majeure dans nos efforts pour protéger le sport féminin"".

Est-ce qu'elle vous choque parce que ça devient impossible de prendre un fucking *meurtrier* pour juger l'entièreté d'une moitié de gens complètement normaux?

J'ai une petite proposition aux obsédés politiques en ce moment: si vous avez tant de misère à qualifier un individu de gauchiste où de droitiste, **c'est peut êtres parce que la majorité du monde ne sont pas des reflets d'un monolithe cliché et quasiment artificiel. **

''En fait, ce qui m’étonne, c’est que ça nous a pris autant de temps à découvrir cette réalité.

En France et en Belgique, ça fait des années que c’est comme ça....

Professeurs qui ont peur d’enseigner certaines matières en classe (sexualité, théorie de l’évolution, Holocauste dans les cours d’histoire).

Enfants juifs intimidés et agressés par des membres de la communauté arabo-musulmane.

Racisme antiblanc et antichrétien.

Refus catégorique de respecter la loi sur la laïcité.

Élèves musulmans priant dans les corridors et les cours d’école.

Manifestation de mépris et de haine envers tout ce qui est français.

Communautarisme exacerbé.

Homophobie décomplexée.

Apologie du nazisme.

Jeunes filles qui subissent des pressions pour porter le voile et «faire le ramadan».

Enseignants qui ont tendance à «surnoter» les élèves arabo-musulmans pour acheter la paix avec leurs parents.

Professeurs menacés de mort pour avoir montré des dessins.

Tout ça fait maintenant partie du quotidien des professeurs français.

Dans certaines écoles françaises, c’est bien simple, on se croirait en Algérie.

Voilà pourquoi je salue la rapidité de réaction du ministre Bernard Drainville.

Parce que ce qui se passe actuellement en France, c’est ce qui nous attend après-demain si nous ne serrons pas la vis tout de suite.''

Je me pose une question à propos d'une situation qui est arrivé à l'école de mon fils.
J'ai besoin de votre opinion.

Mon fils de 8 ans jouais au ping pong avec des amis dans la cour d'école. Ils se sont fait des équipes avec des noms de pays.

Une des équipes était l'Algérie et les 2 jeunes dans cette équipe criaient 1 2 allez l'Algérie. 

Mon fils qui jouait contre eux a crié 1 2 allez l'allergie. Voyez le jeu de mot. 

Ils lui ont dit d'arrêter et il a arrêté. Par contre, la TS de l'école qui est, par ailleur, algérienne à rencontré mon fils. Elle veut qu'il fasse un texte sur la violence verbale et le raciste. 

Je trouve que cela va trop loin pour un jeu de mot sur le nom d'un pays. Mais avant d'intervenir j'aimerais avoir votre opinion.

1lx87qy,"Québécoise, voilée, souverainiste… et pourtant toujours perçue comme une étrangère",islamicallyyyf,Témoignage,215,0.73,375,"Il y a quelques semaines, j’étais dans un café, en train de travailler sur un devoir d’université. Une femme s’est approchée et m’a dit, d’un ton un peu arrogant : « C’est beau de voir que vous faites des efforts pour vous intégrer, ça n’arrive pas à tous les jours ».

J’étais née à quelques rues de là. 
Ma réalité, c’est que je suis Québécoise. Je suis musulmane. Je porte le voile. Et j’ai un profond attachement pour l’indépendance du Québec et pour la langue française. 
Et pourtant, je sens que pour beaucoup… je ne pourrai jamais être tout cela en même temps.
Je vis dans une tension constante : entre ce que je suis, et ce qu’on croit que je suis. Entre la culture québécoise à laquelle je suis profondément attachée, et ma foi, qui est le centre de ma vie.

Je suis née ici. J’ai grandi ici. Le fleuve, les forêts, les hivers, les mots québécois, les débats de société, la fierté d’un peuple qui a résisté à l’effacement, TOUT ÇA m’habite. J’aime ce Québec qui a lutté pour exister, pour être entendu, pour décider par lui-même. Et c’est justement parce que je comprends cette lutte que je m’y reconnais. Parce que moi aussi, je me bats pour exister. Pour être reconnue sans devoir m’excuser de ma foi, que ce soit sur les bancs de l’école ou dans le milieu professionnel. 

Ma foi m’a donné une boussole morale, une force intérieure, un sens du respect, de la justice, de la paix. Et mon identité québécoise m’a appris la solidarité, la fierté, la beauté de la langue, la résistance.

J’écris ce texte pour vous rappeler que des personnes comme moi existent bel et bien, même si on ne rentre pas dans les cases préfabriquées. Des femmes musulmanes, voilées, profondément attachées à leur foi, mais aussi enracinées dans la culture québécoise, francophones de naissance ou de cœur, investies, instruites, sensibles à la société qui les entoure. 
Ce texte n’est pas une revendication victimaire, mais une invitation à élargir l’espace symbolique de l’appartenance collective, pour qu’il reflète enfin la diversité réelle de ceux et celles qui habitent ce territoire avec loyauté, amour et espérance.

Et je vous laisse avec les paroles du grand Michel Tremblay : 	« C'est drôle comme les choses peuvent changer d'aspect, parfois, lorsqu'on les regarde d'un point de vue différent de celui sous lequel on les a toujours connues ».

1bkk9fq,Une chaîne de gym perd 400 millions de dollars après avoir défendu un homme qui se rasait dans les vestiaires des femmes,Smartpen001,Culture,206,0.76,121,"Planet Fitness est dans l'eau chaude. 
Tout a commencé quand une dame avait surpris en flagrant délit un homme qui se rasait le corps dans les vestiaires des femmes, en présence d'une fille de 12 ans.

La dame, voyant la jeune fille visiblement mal à l'aise, avait confronté l'homme en question, qui lui avait répondu qu'il s'identifiait en trans/queer et qu'il avait donc le droit d'être là . Elle a alors pris une photo du suspect et est allée porter plainte à l'administration du gym, et leur a même montré la photo... MAIS le gym a preferé plutôt *défendre* l'individu trans/queer en question, avant de CANCELLER l'abonnement de la dame.

La dame a ensuite parlé de cet incident sur les réseaux sociaux.

Résultat: L'action en bourse de Planet Fitness a immédiatement chuté. L'entreprise a perdu une valeur [400M dollars.

Elle souligne qu'avant de voir ces vidéos, elle souffrait déjà de problèmes de santé mentale.
Ses parents l'ont donc amenée consulter des médecins, qui au lieu de traiter les problèmes mentaux de la fillette, ont dit aux parents : ""il vaut mieux avoir un garçon en vie qu'une fille morte"", en sous-entendant que leur fille allait se suicider si elle ne changeait pas de sexe.

Kayla a donc été mise sous traitement de testostérone ET de bloqueurs de puberté à 12 ans, puis s'est fait couper les seins (double mastectomie) à 13 ans. Tout ceci après une évaluation psychologique de seulement 75 minutes. À 18 ans, elle REGRETTAIT déja profondément sa chirurgie et avait détransitionné. Elle poursuit les 4 médecins qui l'ont traitée en affirmant que l'épreuve l'a laissée avec « des blessures physiques et émotionnelles profondes ».

Elle affirme également que l'hôpital et les médecins ne lui ont pas fourni, à elle et à ses parents, un *consentement éclairé*, qui aurait donné lieu à des séances de thérapie, ce qui ne lui a jamais été offert. Ses avocats ont critiqué les procédures comme étant ""une forme insensée de maltraitance envers les enfants"".

What happened to working hard for a few years, even a decade and you'd be able to afford the basics of life.

Wages go up 1 dollar, and the price of electricity, food, rent, taxes, insurance all go up by 5. It's like an endless race where our wage is permanently slowed.

Buy a house, buy a car, own a few toys and travel a little. Have a family, live life and hopefully give the next generation a better life. It's not a lot to ask for, in fact it was the only carot on a stick the older generation dangled for us. What do we have besides hope? 

I don't know what direction will change this, but it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel when you have a whole generation that has been waiting for a chance to start life for a long time. 2007-8 crash wasn't even the start of our problems today. 

Please someone convince me there is still hope for what I thought was the best place to live in the world as a child.






edit: It is my opinion the ruling elite, and in particular the politically involved billion dollar corporations have artificially inflated the price of life itself, and commoditized it.

I believe the problem is the people have lost real input in their governments and their communities.

I wanted to hear Canadian perspectives on this issue.

As an American I feel powerless and paralyzed by my own government. I am doing what I can and am asking others to help support solutions to the problems that are mounting in our interconnected societies. Musk's actions, including his endorsement of far right political movements in Europe, platforming extremist voices, and his influence over critical communications infrastructure through Starlink, raise serious questions about national security, democratic integrity, and economic sovereignty. Tesla, Starlink, and X are not just products; they are part of a larger ecosystem controlled by an individual whose actions increasingly conflict with Western values.

Edit: Thank you for all your responses and your thoughtful points of view. I should amend some things here. When I say ""Banning"" Starlink and Tesla I am not talking about criminalizing the use of such items, rather phasing them out while Canada develops viable alternatives. Reliance on the United States for critical infrastructure such as internet access is a mistake, and I am saying this as an American.

On top of that transgender rights across [the US seem to be under attack](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-gender-executive-order-1.7436438). It seems [that trans people can no longer even enter the US](https://www.erininthemorning.com/p/marco-rubio-may-have-just-banned).

That's not even getting to the fact that some states don't even allow trans people to [use public restrooms anymore](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/nondiscrimination/bathroom_bans). Others are [banning gender affirming care altogether.](https://www.kxan.com/news/texas-politics/texas-house-bill-ban-gender-affirming-care-transgender-adults/) 

So long story short: Trans people have plenty of good reason to leave the US since all signs seem to show the GOP don't want them there.

It'd be one hell of a power play. With the US making soft threats to annex Canada, this would be an ideal way to make our forces stronger. We'd get a hell of a boost to enlistment numbers and many of the new recruits and it'd save months and even years of training depending on the military field.

It may require an act from parliament to make changes since the[ US officially is not a country legally recognized by Canada to be eligible for LGBTQIA+ refugee status](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/lgbtq-americans-canada-trump-1.7469516).

It feels like the only luxury brand that has a real following in Canada is Canada Goose, but there is a strong practical element to that because of the climate here.

In Canada you do see a small luxury goods presence in the biggest cities like Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, but it seems more like it's aimed at visitors or people from other countries. I don't think too many Canadians are shopping at Burberry, Ferragamo, Hermes and the like. Of course, in smaller Canadian cities those types of retailers have little if any presence at all.

What I am wondering is why does that type of thing have so little traction in Canada compared to other countries? Canadians certainly do have money for discretionary spending, but they tend to spend on other things instead.

(And just to be clear, I am not suggesting that Canadians should be spending big on luxury goods...

1k2q9i5,Why do public bathroom stalls in Canada offer so little privacy? A frustrated European here.,Proof_Station9238,,1701,0.94,799,"Hi Reddit,

I’m a Russian-born girl who grew up in the Netherlands since I was a toddler. I recently started a long-distance relationship with a French-Canadian guy. Since summer 2024 I’ve been visiting the Ottawa area more frequently—and there's one thing that still completely baffles (and honestly frustrates) me: **the lack of privacy in public bathrooms.**

In the Netherlands (and most of Europe, really), public bathroom stalls are basically mini rooms: full walls, full doors, often going from floor to ceiling, or at least enough coverage that you don’t feel exposed.

But in Canada? I’ve encountered bathroom stalls in malls, cafés, even airports where:

* There are **gaps the size of a hand** between the door and the frame. I can literally make eye contact with people walking by.
* The walls stop well above the floor and often don’t reach that ceiling either, so **everything** echoes—and everyone can hear you pee.
* The locks often feel flimsy, like a suggestion more than a guarantee.

I honestly feel so uncomfortable using these bathrooms. It’s like being *semi-visible* while doing something extremely private. I keep wondering—**how is this normal here?**

I’ve even gotten to the point where I *MacGyver* my own solutions—holding up scarves, stuffing tissues and toilet paper in the door crack, or using my coat as a privacy curtain. 

So, Canadians (or anyone who’s noticed this):

* Is there a historical or cultural reason for this layout?
* Do people here just not care?
* Am I the only one having a mini existential crisis every time I need to pee in public?

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk, held live from a stall with three-inch floor clearance and enough door-gap to pass notes through. 🇨🇦🚽",2025-04-19T02:50:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACanadian/comments/1k2q9i5/why_do_public_bathroom_stalls_in_canada_offer_so/,

Canadians overall did not take well to the carbon tax which is modelled after those in multiple EU countries. To truly diversity our trade, we are going to have to meet a lot of Euro centric conditions that we currently as a country do not hold. Many of them on a similar level of change as the carbon tax. Do you feel the current situation is enough for people to make the sacrifices that will be required to move us forward on the world stage, or is this just initial anger that will cool once we see the requirements to truly begin moving trade?

Note: I don’t care about opinions on the carbon tax itself. That is specifically not my question. There are other regulations that will be just as hard. I do agree there needs to be room for some exemptions due to the physical size vs population requirements of our country.

1k9v7u9,"Am I the only one who finds it annoying when someone says ""America"" to mean the US?",Elcoid,,1288,0.75,1151,"Edit 2:

I want to be clear. My post is not about saying that Canadians should be called ""Americans"". Focus on the title.

Original post:

I mean, America is the continent that spans from Greenland to Patagonia. Why would one of the many countries on it decide to refer to itself using its continent's name instead of its own name?

This is probably an extension of saying ""American"" to mean the inhabitants of the US. So here's what I suggest: let's call them ""USAmerican"", like the Germans do (and possibly others).

In French, ""Américain"" is also often used, but we really should say ""États-Unien"". It makes way more sense! It sounds weird the first few times, but it really feels more right after a while (it's true, I promise, try it!)

Edit 1:

Let me add some clarification. I see that many Canadians really dislike the idea of being called Americans. My intention was not to insult or hurt anybody. I'm sorry if I did.

Also, my post was ***certainly not*** a push to remove the Canadian identity by calling people Americans and using North America as the logic, as some people suggested. It was actually the opposite!

The Americas, North America, South America, Central America, whatever you call this place (as some pointed out, there are other languages in which the word that is cognate with America is used to refer to the whole landmass as a single continent), is home to more than a billion people living in more than 50 countries. Of course this population doesn't identify as a single united group of people. But what I meant was that roughly a third of the population lives in one country known as the United States of America. Unlike in the case of the United Mexican States, there are other places with America in their name (listed above) that are bigger and/or outside of the country. So why is it usual for the inhabitants and official bodies of this country to use the name ""America"" to talk about themselves (edit: and only themselves, not the other people in North/South America)? Regardless of the common usage of the word, don't you find it strange?

I looked at the top-level comments only, because sub-comments contained conversations that were not directly answering the initial questions. (However I did read as many sub-comments as I could. There were interesting discussions here and there. Thank you everyone for participating!)

I grouped the comments by user to avoid overcounting people who wrote several comments. Each user received one or several labels, as described below. Some users wrote nuanced and multifaceted comments, and thus received labels that are contradictory at first sight (for example, a few people were labelled with Disagree and Agree because they expressed ambivalence).

The labels:

* Disagree: The person disagrees that what I'm describing is a problem and/or likes the situation
* Strongly Disagree: The person disagrees with expressiveness or uses strong language, such as ""cringey"", ""pedantic fuck"", ""Most people aren't so stupid"", ""I find the pedants who whine about dumb shit like this annoying."", ""I find obtuse posts like this annoying.""
* Agree: The person agrees that it's problematic and/or dislikes the situation
* Strongly Agree: The person agrees with expressiveness, uses alternatives to ""American"" in day-to-day life, and/or uses strong language, such as ""It drives me crazy"", ""I absolutely HATE it."", ""I totally agree!"", ""it bothers me! Always has."", ""will object every time someone calls them America"", ""It's annoying AF and is sort of indicative of the US's main character syndrome""
* Don't Care: The person takes the time to write a comment explaining that the subject is not worth their time, that they don't care, or that there are more important things to worry about.
* Status Quo: Regardless of agreement or disagreement, the person expresses that it has been this way for a long time or says that the alternatives are not adequate, saying for example ""that ship has sailed"", ""What's the alternative?"", ""It is what it is, and It won't change."", ""it's gonna be hard to change that""
* Didn't Answer: The person tries to answer the questions, but either talks about something else (sometimes a digression after a valid answer) or doesn't provide any actual answer
* Alone: The person specifically writes that I am the only one with my opinion
* Not Alone: The person specifically writes that I am not the only one with my opinion or mentions people other than themselves with the same opinion

Users who did not try to answer the questions (some people told anecdotes or wrote things that were completely unrelated) did not receive any label.

No AI was used for the labelling process. I know from first-hand experience how badly they can hallucinate sometimes.

The results: For a total of 639 analyzed comments, here are the number of comments for each of the associated label.

    Strongly Disagree:  30 ( 4.7%)
    Disagree:          144 (22.5%)
    Don't Care:         60 ( 9.4%)
    Agree:             111 (17.4%)
    Strongly Agree:     64 (10.0%)
    
    Alone:              32 ( 5.0%)
    Not Alone:          49 ( 7.7%)
    
    Status Quo:         58 ( 9.1%)
    Didn't Answer:     133 (20.8%)

Remember that it's normal if the numbers don't add up to 639 and the percentages don't add up to 100%, since a large amount of comments received more than one label and some didn't receive any.

Hopefully this will entertain at least one person other than me :D

1o2hzsq,Are we quietly slipping into a food insecurity crisis in Canada?,m-dsL,Locked - Brigaded,1061,0.95,405,"Groceries have always been expensive, but lately, it feels like something deeper is happening.

I travel often across Manitoba and occasionally into Nunavut and I can’t shake the feeling that a serious food insecurity crisis is creeping up on us. Prices in rural and northern communities are unreal. A bag of apples or a carton of eggs can cost double or triple what we pay in Winnipeg. Families are stretching every dollar, and small local stores are barely hanging on.

It’s not just about prices either it’s access and quality. In many places, fresh produce is a luxury. And yet, we have so much land and potential. I sometimes wonder why we don’t see more people getting into small-scale farming, hydroponics, or even community gardens.

Or maybe I’m just too broke to survive current grocery prices and this is my villain origin story 😅

What are you all noticing in your regions?
Are we sleepwalking into a bigger food crisis than we realize?

After lunch, dinner and gas, a family of four will need to spend $600 to $800 on a day of skiing. That is no longer something a middle class family can afford to go on a regular basis.

Here’s a list of potential advantages:

**For Canada:**
1. **Economic Growth**: Increased labor mobility could address labor shortages in key sectors, boosting productivity and economic growth.
2. **Skill Diversification**: Access to a wider pool of skilled workers from Europe could fill gaps in industries like healthcare, technology, and engineering.
3. **Cultural Exchange**: Enhanced cultural diversity and exchange of ideas, fostering innovation and creativity.
4. **Tourism and Education**: Increased European visitors and students could boost Canada’s tourism and education sectors.
5. **Trade and Investment**: Stronger ties with European countries could lead to increased trade and foreign direct investment.
6. **Aging Population**: Influx of younger workers from Europe could help mitigate the challenges of Canada’s aging population.
7. **Knowledge Transfer**: Collaboration and knowledge sharing between Canadian and European professionals could drive advancements in science, technology, and research.
8. **Global Competitiveness**: Enhanced labor mobility could make Canada more attractive to global talent and businesses.

**For Europe:**
1. **Employment Opportunities**: Europeans could access new job markets in Canada, reducing unemployment in certain regions.
2. **Economic Integration**: Strengthened economic ties with Canada could create new business opportunities and expand markets for European companies.
3. **Brain Circulation**: Instead of ""brain drain,"" Europe could benefit from a two-way flow of talent, with professionals gaining international experience and returning with new skills.
4. **Innovation and Research**: Collaboration with Canadian institutions and industries could accelerate innovation and research in fields like renewable energy, AI, and healthcare.
5. **Cultural Exchange**: Canadians moving to Europe could enrich European societies with diverse perspectives and cultural practices.
6. **Youth Mobility**: Young Europeans could gain international work experience, enhancing their skills and employability.
7. **Tourism and Education**: Increased Canadian visitors and students in Europe could boost local economies and academic institutions.
8. **Global Influence**: Stronger ties with Canada could enhance Europe’s geopolitical influence and cooperation on global issues like climate change and security.

**Mutual Benefits:**
1. **Strengthened Bilateral Relations**: Freedom of movement would deepen political, economic, and cultural ties between Canada and Europe.
2. **Shared Prosperity**: A larger, more dynamic labor market could lead to shared economic growth and stability.
3. **Talent Pool Expansion**: Both regions would benefit from access to a broader talent pool, driving innovation and competitiveness.
4. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Increased mobility could foster joint initiatives in research, technology, and sustainability.
5. **Resilience to Global Challenges**: A more interconnected workforce could better address global challenges like pandemics, climate change, and economic crises.
6. **Improved Quality of Life**: Individuals in both regions would have more opportunities for personal and professional growth.

Overall, freedom of movement between Canada and Europe could create a win-win scenario. I would like to hear more in the comments.",2025-02-05T14:19:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACanadian/comments/1iii99i/would_you_welcome_freedom_of_movement_between/,

The hip in the 70s all the way to the late 00s have had a huge following in listeners across Canada and northern parts of America not saying it isn't still big in canada its just no one really mentions them anymore and I don't hear them on any radio stations anymore. So I was wondering if people just forgot about this Canadian treasure since they were the biggest bands in canada (one of them) and has spread there music in so many ways emotionally, lyrically, instrumentality and has inspired lots of other Canadian bands (small) to go into there journey. They have influenced so many people and brought so many communities together and I don't see that anymore.. 

Sorry for the yap session, but just wanted to spread a question that I have.

1k2kczj,What the heck is a “pure blood Canadian”?,Fran87412,,838,0.84,386,"A friend shared a post that was largely detailing why not to vote liberal (transparency: I am voting liberal, but I read out of curiosity), from an anti-vaxxer, who mentioned The Great Reset (conspiracy theory?), and the post ended saying “God bless pure blood Canadians”.

When I googled nothing really came up, there was something about French Canadians, and something about Indigenous, but from the context of the post it made me think those were not what the poster meant. 

Honestly my brain thought of parallels to Nazi Germany, or Harry Potter. Should I be worried about this term, or am I reading too much into it?

UPDATE: based on the comments here and re-reading the post, I’m concluding that what was meant was unvaccinated plus alluding to the “Canadian pride” that the freedom convoy claimed to represent - drawing on that to rally the troops in this current federal election. While I don’t take the person I know to be a white supremacist, I think it’s prudent to take into account who was involved in the convoy and that many conspiracy theories (as a couple were named in the post) have roots in anti-semitism. And using terminology that implies purity or superiority can be a slippery slope. Thanks everyone for your perspectives!

16bx251,Has anyone else basically stopped eating out due to shrinkflation?,LOGOisEGO,,821,0.96,674,"This might be long.  Just a couple recent antidotes that I've noticed on our last couple date nights.

With shrinkflation the last couple of years, yeah you're not getting what you used to pay for.  There is a sacrifice in quality portions and menu options.  
Some of the bigger chains are eating the cost as they can afford to, and need to remain consistent. The smaller ma-pa's I used to frequent often leave me feeling hungry after paying 30-40% more than a year ago. Pay more, get less.  
Just one example. This bbq place I used to go to on special occasions used to have a meat platter with a variety of smoked meats for $45. It would be the main split between 2-3 people, and you pay $4 more for individual sides, so we'd get 1 per person and just all share. So around $68 plus one beer.  So a bit over $100 for four and we wern't left hungry.  Not bad, $25/person  
We went back last week, and they no longer have the platter. The individual meats are now $15 each meat, so $60 to get the equivalent of the old platter, and 8$ a side, so double. So the equivalent meal for four would now would be $108ish BEFORE tip, a 38% increase in price for less food, and we didn't bother getting any drinks.  
My fav sushi place is the same deal. we used to go there for quality over quantity so not like we're pigging out and to us that's perfect. Its higher end, so we go once or twice a year. What we would order 9 months ago is now at least 40-50% more and portions were smaller/priced differently with limited platters. We paid almost double, were left hungry and ended up stopping for fucking fries while we drove home laughing in disbelief. Mcdonalds fries are now $4.20 for a regular!  
Also remember, when the itemized price goes up 40%, you're also tipping 15+6% on that, so your tip is now 21% on what would have been last years bill. Unfortunately, we tip less now, or we stay home and complain on Reddit!

We both have good incomes and can't justify our monthly or bi-monthly nightlife anymore.  I feel like my grandparents!",2023-09-06T17:42:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACanadian/comments/16bx251/has_anyone_else_basically_stopped_eating_out_due/,

Yes, I’m brown.
No, I don’t have family in India.
No, I haven’t lived there.
Also I don’t have Indian accent in fact the man thinks I speak in British accent. 

And yet, every week, he circles back to the same question as if I’m incomplete unless he can label me properly.

I’m not sure how to handle it anymore. I’ve been polite, I’ve been firm, I’ve deflected. But it keeps happening.

Thanks so much to everyone who responded I really appreciate it.

Just to clarify: I did mention where my parents are from when he first asked. But it seems that because it wasn’t the answer he was looking for, he kept circling back to the topic in different ways. It’s not that I mind questions but when they become repetitive and loaded, it starts to feel less like curiosity and more like something else.

I’ve recently learned about the NDP party, and I’m confused. They’ve been around for a long time but don’t seem to have won much of anything despite their policies seeming more in line with the stereotypical Canadian image.   From what I’ve always assumed about Canadian values, the NDP policies seem a better fit than the other two parties, yet they be always losing to them. There’s got to be something I’m missing.....

Edit: A lot of people are mentioning that it's our civic duty to serve and while I agree I would say that for a lot of people feeding their families and making rent comes before their civic duties. I wish we had a better system where ALL people could afford to take part in this process.

1jfsfcu,Why not Saskatchewan?,stumpy_chica,,659,0.96,1093,"I was born and raised in Saskatchewan and am now raising my own family. We consistently have lower unemployment than most of the country, a lower cost of living, lots of different types of industry (potash, uranium, oil, agriculture). For all intents and purposes, on paper, we should be a booming, ""have"" province. 

So, out of curiosity to the rest of the country, have you ever considered moving here? Why or why not? What are the biggest deterrents? 

Keep in mind, I'm not going to argue with you over what you say our disadvantages are. I am more interested in seeing what the outside perception is from the rest of the country. Thanks!

Edit (after reading through comments). Thanks so much for all of the feedback everyone! A lot is what I expected. A lot of us hate the Sask Party too, believe me. A lot of us feel the divide between rural and city life and social attitudes. I feel like there are a few misconceptions (like lack of lakes, scenery, etc), but a lot of that comes from not venturing far from the #1. 

You're all right. It gets DAMN cold here in the winter, but also DAMN hot in the summer. It's a different kind of heat than other parts of the country that have more humidity, but we have a lot of sun and it's frequently above 30 in the summer months. 

Something I was expecting to see but didn't really see touched on was healthcare. Although I suppose with the option of Alberta right on our doorstep for anything our system can't handle, it's actually not as bad as what I've heard from other provinces. But we do have lack of technology and services that are available other places in the country. On the flip side, we have some of the most stringent regulations for the certification of doctors, with higher required scores than, I believe, the entire rest of the country. So I will say, in my experience, I've experienced waits, sure, but I have no complaints ever over the quality of care I've received from any Dr or nurse in our province. This is just my personal experience, though, because I have definitely heard differently from others.

I was totally expecting the lack of night life, city life comments because it's totally true compared to more vibrant cities. We try in Regina. We really do! I think Saskatoon succeeds a bit more than we do. We have good beer and pubs and food if you ever visit! I know Saskatoon does as well. Regina births some restaurants and pubs that have expanded beyond our city. Leopold's Tavern comes to mind. 

Honestly, don't totally overlook us in your travel journeys. Get off the Trans Canada highway and experience our beautiful North. It's a totally different world than what you expect. We have over 100,000 lakes. If you don't want to go all the way north, Duck Mountain and Cypress Hills are, in my experience, really nice provincial parks that you can find in the southern part of the province. Also, anything in the Quappelle Valley is worth checking out, believe me. We don't have mountains, but we do have that, and it's close to the #1 with absolutely stunning scenery. And you get those skies everyone so fondly speaks of!

I consider myself pretty outgoing, warm, respectful, cultured and extroverted but not too much to creep out anyone lol.
I work in corporate and have a few friends outside of work who are not “local”.
I’ve connected with a few locals and even though it felt genuine connection that would probably lead to a good friendship (guys and girls), I find that majority of them have tight circles and don’t let anyone in.

I’m from Scotland and we see a lot of US MAGA nonsense going on, and unfortunately my parents have become huge Trump supporters and as such we can’t talk foreign politics much without the conversation becoming redundant or heated.

My parents were adamant that things in Canada are a complete mess, so much so that Alberta wants to ‘leave’ Canada (whatever that means) and wants nothing to do with the rest of it. I hadn’t heard or read even a snippet of this, so I wanted to ask Canadians if this is some MAGA related propaganda nonsense, and lies, or is there some truth that we’re not seeing?

I can see where this has a bit of the ""prodigal son"" sting to it and any kind of financial incentive would probably be the wrong approach (you want to return to Canada because you love it and you want to make it stronger - you can't for example then ask for a larger capital gains exception so you can further maximize your Yankee earnings).

But maybe a good, welcoming marketing campaign?  With the current immigration woes in Canada however, I don't know how well the messaging of ""come on home"" would sit in terms of its effect on housing, draw on medical services infrastructure, for example.

1iottsw,Why Doesn’t Canada Have a Sovereign Wealth Fund?,doorstoinfinity,,428,0.9,476,"Serious question for those in the know. The Trump tariffs and the media frenzy around them have exposed major inefficiencies in Canada’s trade and resource strategies.

Canada is rich in natural resources, yet we follow a bizarre model: we export raw materials, where the real value-add—processing, refining, and manufacturing—takes place. Economically, we know that extraction alone isn’t where the money is; the wealth is in the next steps of production.

Countries such as Norway, China, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, etc. have sovereign wealth funds to ensure long-term economic benefits. Yet Canada has none.

So not only is the real value of our resources being captured elsewhere, but we also fail to reinvest in our own future prosperity. These are finite resources, yet there’s no structured plan to convert them into lasting economic gains. Instead, we’re letting others reap the rewards.

And beyond that, even inter-provincial trade is heavily restricted. Sometimes, it seems like Canada operates as if it’s a massive country with hundreds of millions of people, layering on unnecessary barriers. But a smaller country should be nimble, attracting investment and driving productivity. Now politicians say we need to ""incentivize businesses""—so were we *de-incentivizing* them this whole time?

At this point, Canada feels like a cow being milked—and we’re just standing there, letting it happen until we're skin and bones.

What am I missing here? There’s no way the government and business leaders don’t see this, right? So why has nothing been done about it this whole time?",2025-02-13T16:17:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskACanadian/comments/1iottsw/why_doesnt_canada_have_a_sovereign_wealth_fund/,

1hjpmpm,Would you support a Crown Corporation building affordable housing?,TCadd81,,417,0.93,429,"Given that we have a significant housing crisis including people / families without housing at all, and given that all political parties agree this is a problem, how would you feel about this possible long-term solution:

Would you support the creation of a crown corporation who's mandate was to build affordable housing across Canada that is not profitable enough for builders today to want to do?

To clarify, the Federal Government of Canada already funds, directly and indirectly, the building of homes across Canada under various programs but at a much smaller scale and using inefficient patchwork processes. The crown corporation would probably function as the prime contractor and recipient of such funds in order to use them more efficiently and equitably across the nation.

Further clarification, Canada used to do this very well if in a different manner, and up until the early 1980s it helped to keep virtually everyone housed. We were, at that time, a prime example of excellence in housing.

Specifics of exactly how it would work are undetermined. This is just a question on the support of the concept, but feel free to give your own ideas after your answer.

We are a group of friends who have already booked flight tickets from Europe to Seattle this summer. The plan was to do a road trip down the US west coast visiting cities, national parks and meeting ordinary Americans along the way. 

The current US administration has made some of us reconsider our plans and instead turn north and do a 14 day road trip in Canada as we would feel better with spending our money there. The other part of the group is not entirely convinced that a Canada trip will offer the same experience as it will then primarily be a nature/hiking trip with less fun city / nightlife experiences. We’ve been talking about a US road trip for nearly 10 years and some feel it’s a shame to rearrange because of a crazy administration while others think enough is enough.

So to the kindest people om the planet: Can you help me convince the friend group that a Canada road trip would be able to offer a similar (or better!) experience than the one currently planned. What would you say?

Want the optimal property? Do not use a realtor.

* Go to [Realtor.ca](https://Realtor.ca) and [Housesigma.com](https://Housesigma.com) to find your property.

Scared of being scammed by the listing agent or private seller?

* Your realtor’s ~~only~~ *primary* goals ~~is~~ are maximum commission *as quickly as possible*. ~~They~~ Most will say anything to ~~get it~~ achieve them and ~~they~~ *most* won’t think twice about scamming you.
* Your lawyer protects you from being legally scammed, not your realtor.
* Add a condition in the offer that allows your lawyer to review it.
* If you are in a bidding war, a house inspection condition likely won’t be an option anyway.
* Include a house inspection condition if you can but keep in mind that house inspectors aren’t held accountable if they miss something and they always will. It’s still a good idea but there are many potential problems that don’t assess.

Negotiate cash back from the listing agent.

* Listing agent doesn’t provide any service to you when you’re finding your own properties
* Mutual representation is fundamentally impossible. Listing agent is not helping you negotiate the best deal because it would reduce their commission.
* Let them make more than listing commission and they will ALWAYS convince the seller to accept your offer ( completely unfair to the seller but that’s another topic).
* E.g. Listing commission is $25K. Their agreement with the seller if no buyer’s agent is $40K. Ask for $10K cash back. They receive an extra $5K. You pay yourself $10K for finding your own property. Win-Win.
* Selling agent unfortunately will not communicate such an arrangement to the seller. Another example of bad realtor ethics and why no one should use realtors.

Been looking at properties with your realtor but the choices are limited?

* A great property likely exists but if your realtor can't make full buyer commission, they will never let you know about it, make up fake reasons to avoid it, or if you insist on an offer, never submit your offer to the seller.
* Need proof? Read This: [www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6209706](https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.6209706)

Always request # of offers confirmation from RECO (in Ontario) after closing.

* Link: [https://www.reco.on.ca/complaints-enforcement/want-find-many-offers-made-property/](https://www.reco.on.ca/complaints-enforcement/want-find-many-offers-made-property/)
* Selling agents use ghost offers to influence your offer and maximize their commission.
* ASK SELLING AGENT TO CONFIRM # OF REGISTERED OFFERS IN WRITING SO YOU HAVE EVIDENCE.
* It is illegal for them to even hint at the possibility of another offer if it hasn't been registered.
* It will take many months but if you have evidence, the agent will be disciplined, The conviction will be displayed on their RECO profile ( search link below ).

If you can't be convinced to buy/sell real estate without a realtor, at least search for their convictions on RECO and hopefully that will convince you!

* Link: [https://www.reco.on.ca/RegistrantSearch](https://www.reco.on.ca/RegistrantSearch)
* Most people using realtors don't check or report them which explains why their may be no conviction records for your realtor. This needs to change.

From [u/that\_was\_funny\_lol/](https://www.reddit.com/user/that_was_funny_lol/) :  don’t use any suggested vendors from the realtor.  Find your own vendors, assume everybody is out to fuck you. 

From u/[Juliuscesear1990/](https://www.reddit.com/user/Juliuscesear1990/) :  contact your local property tax department and find out what the taxes  are and what the assessment is, the number they tell you (if they do)  might be WAY off.

libcqb,Bullet Dodged- First Time Home Buyers Be Ware.,ztuperd,Housing,10401,0.96,2017,"Disclaimer this is a bit of rant. I'm also sorry if this is not the right sub for this.

I've been working with an real-estate agent since mid December as a first time home buyer. His team is supposed to be the best in the city/surrounding area and I'm so angry.

Recently we found a place we liked. We wanted to offer a bit over asking. Our agent was really irritated at us, saying we will never buy a place if we don't go in majorly over asking. Said the listed price is just a tactic and we needed to go at minimum 100k over, no conditions. Given that this was already 650k townhome (that needed work), we backed out as we're in no rush. Just found the sold listing- sold for 15k over asking. Had I listened to this weasel I would have paid 85K over. What the hell is this. I understand that offers have been ludicrous lately but how much of this is based on pushy agents adding fuel to the fire. I've emailed him the sold listing- no response.

Previous to that we saw a townhome for 750k which was one year old. He also told us we needed to bid at least 50k over asking for the buyers to even consider us. Guess what? Listing recently expired and the owners dropped 50k.  He's using FOMO to scare us and how many agents are doing the same but are falling for it?

I've been using HouseSigma to track these listings. I feel so manipulated. How is it that there is no transparency in bidding like other counties (Australia). I want to know what other people are bidding, I don't want to be pushed by someone who has a vested interest in making more commission.

My question is who can I connect with about this, anyone in government, a regulatory body? In my opinion, this lack of transparency needs to end.

&#x200B;

**As an aside:** A real estate agents entire job could be done through an app. How is it that they have such a monopoly in Canada. It's 2021 and the industry has not changed even with technology.

&#x200B;

**Edit:** Thank you for your responses, I didn’t anticipate this much activity in such a short amount of time. I will be contacting my MP about bidding transparency and encourage anyone who feels the same about this topic to email their representatives/ whoever else you feel may help. Your feedback may also help others who find themselves in the same boat.",2021-02-12T08:48:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/libcqb/bullet_dodged_first_time_home_buyers_be_ware/,

One can browse all the listings on the internet this isn't 1950 anymore.

Unfortunately you do need an agent to be taken seriously by most sellers so we got one to check that box.

We found a nice home listed for 660K. Our realtor suggested we offer 635K to be ""respectful"". We ignored and lowballed in at 595K. We knew this property was sitting for months so there was leverage.

They came back at 635K (I guarantee the buying and selling agent discussed this). But no - this isn't what we wanted. Came back at 610K final offer. There are other homes available, no home is so special that it's worth overpaying for.

kv7oga,Housing is never going to get any better.,DoctorShemp,Housing,8228,0.95,2644,"Call me a pessimist, but I don’t think housing prices are ever going to get better in Canada, at least in our lifetimes. There is no “bubble”, prices are not going to come crashing down one day, and millennials, gen Z, and those that come after are not going to ever stumble into some kind of golden window to buy a home. The best window is today. In 5, 10, 20 years or whatever, house prices are just going to be even more insane. More and more permanent homes are being converted into rentals and Air B&Bs, the rate at which new homes are being built is not even close to matching the increasing demand for them, and Canada’s economy is too reliant on its real estate market for it to ever go bust. It didn’t happen in ’08, its not happening now during the pandemic, and its not going to happen anytime in the foreseeable future. This is just the reality.

I see people on reddit ask, “but what’s going to happen when most of the young working generation can no longer afford homes, surely prices have to come down then?”. LOL no. Wealthy investors will still be more than happy to buy those homes and rent them back to you. The economy does not care if YOU can buy a home, only if SOMEONE will buy it. There will continue to be no stop to landlords and foreign speculators looking for new homes to add to their list. Then when they profit off of those homes they will buy more properties and the cycle continues.

So what’s going to happen instead? I think the far more likely outcome is that there is going to be a gradual shift in our societal view of home ownership, one that I would argue has already started. Currently, many people view home ownership as a milestone one is meant to reach as they settle into their adult lives. I don’t think future generations will have the privilege of thinking this way. I think that many will adopt the perception that renting for life is simply the norm, and home ownership, while nice, is a privilege reserved for the wealthy, like owning a summer home or a boat. Young people are just going to have to accept that they are not a part of the game. At best they will have to rely on their parents being homeowners themselves to have a chance of owning property once they pass on. 

I know this all sounds pretty glum and if someone want to shed some positive light on the situation then by all means please do, but I’m completely disillusioned with home ownership at this point.",2021-01-11T12:43:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kv7oga/housing_is_never_going_to_get_any_better/,

tmvjsn,[UPDATE] My mom (60F) is still pressuring me (25F)to add me as a third person on her new $820k mortgage. I really don’t want to as my husband and I are looking to buy our own home. She states doing this will build my credit for a new mortgage down the line,,Housing,5460,0.96,441,"Last week I posted what my mother was trying to do which was have me co-sign her mortgage. Many people have asked for an update. Unfortunately I’m not allowed to post the link to the last post on here.

Yesterday, I spoke with the mortgage advisor who not only admitted that my mom was a difficult client as she was trying to do the impossible by getting this mortgage but he also revealed that the reason she needed me to co-sign the mortgage was because she did not want to listen to his recommendation which was to return the car she had leased, on which the maturity date is almost due and to not finance a new car until she gets her mortgage funded (2 months max) This is to ensure she does not have too much debt and that her pre-approval amount stays the same. 

Instead of doing that, she wanted me on the mortgage so she can increase the funding approval rate AND get a new car financed. My husband and I were disgusted and shocked. The mortgage advisor was very honest and stated that if I get in on this it will significantly reduce my borrowing power and I will be on the hook for years. He even joked and asked “would you like to stay stuck renting with the inability to borrow and a huge dip on your credit while she drives the newest fancy cars and lives in a big home?”. He told us not to do it and think of our future (we’re expecting a baby in the fall). 

To cut it short, most of you were right, she had no intention of helping me in the long run and it was only to satisfy her needs while having no issues leaving my husband and baby and i on the hook for almost $1m. I have confronted my mom who has yet to answer my texts and my husband has suggested that we cut contact with her. 

I wanted to take the time to thank you all for your honest advice and to the mortgage advisor who put reality before money.",2022-03-24T14:52:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/tmvjsn/update_my_mom_60f_is_still_pressuring_me_25fto/,

o33s3m,Why Do We Tip,BlueCake2,,5175,0.81,2897,"In come the downvotes. Very controversial topic which is going to get hated on by the general public but I’d still like to know if my logic isn’t sound here.

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve been tipping my entire life, but money matters to me more now that I have more responsibilities. 

Why are we tipping? The waiter is just doing their job and they’re getting paid an hourly wage for it, why does society feel like it’s mandatory for us to pay an additional 15% of our meal, at a minimum, for someone doing their job. The rebuttal to this is usually, “It helps them make a living wage.” But with this logic, we should be tipping all minimum wage workers so everyone can have a living wage. Why are we not tipping the other minimum wage workers who provide us with a service like McDonalds workers we come across. They have hard shifts too and feed you, standing there near the hot kitchen all day prepping food.

Back in the day serving used to be a profession for single moms to provide for their kids so I guess the tradition of tipping got passed down. But now there’s so many opportunistic in North America, if servers are unhappy with their wage they should study something and look for something else. Most of the time now servers are young, so very unlikely they are supporting a family and more likely it’s a side job while studying or they’re unsure what career path they want to follow.

TLDR: Why is tipping necessary. I work hard for my money and need it too, why am I giving it to someone else for doing their job.

Edit: For those of you mentioning that you should tip for good service or tip to push waiters above minimum, I’d say $3-5 is a fair tip. Why should a normal tip be considered 15% or even now 20% is being pushed as the norm. People with families eating out really get shafted by the percentage. I don’t think it’s fair to still be expected to pay 15% off hundreds of dollars at a minimum. In Europe the $3-5 is the norm when tipping if the waiter really went above and beyond, and the service is as good as here if not better. And in other parts of Europe and even Asia, tips aren’t even expected but the service is still great because people take pride in their work. In order for things to change here, it has to start somewhere. Right now restaurant owners don’t want the tipping system to change because they save money, servers don’t want the system to change because they make much higher than minimum wage. So consumers are left footing the bill.

Edit: I’m surprised as to how many people are on the same page. The only way for this broken system to change is to unfortunately stop tipping unnecessarily. You shouldn’t feel the need to tip anything or be shamed into it. Otherwise employers will not feel the need to change anything because they’re saving heavily, and the servers will never demand more from their employers because they’re making way above minimum. All at the same time the government loses out on taxes. I hope to someday transition to places like Australia, Europe, and parts in Asia where you can enjoy a meal without being guilted into tipping. The food in these countries are still reasonably priced or cheaper (for those of you saying food will be more expensive) and the waiters still do a great job because they understand it’s what they’re paid to do and if they don’t someone else will do it. We can’t expect anything to change by doing nothing.

Edit: Too bad the thread is getting locked. I hope we can all find a solution to this crazy system put in place. For now, I will personally go by dollar value tip instead of percent and move away from being shamed into tipping and only tip if it’s deserved.",2021-06-18T20:04:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/o33s3m/why_do_we_tip/,
ltlyzz,Bragging about RESP,SelenaJnb,Investing,5100,0.96,457,"I have been investing in an RESP for my son since he was born. As a single mom there have been months where I barely scraped together the $100. When he was 10 I received some money and I was able to catch up on all the unused contribution room. 

He’s in grade 11 now and looking at universities. The one in our town said it was an average of $8000 tuition for the year. So about $32,000 for a 4 year degree. 

Guys - he’s going to have about $60,000 in his RESP!!!!  That can go to books and everything else he might need!  

I am so proud of myself for setting up my son to start off strong. I have brought him to every annual meeting with our investment banker (edit: financial adviser not investment banker) so he learns that investing is a normal part of adulting.  I have worked so hard to give him a future and it is coming to fruition!

Edit: I invested in mutual funds through TD Bank. Every year I met with my banker to make sure the mutual fund was still the right fit based on how soon the RESP was going to be used. 

My strategy was consistent contributions. I started off with $100/month. When he was 10 I was able to start contributing more. I maxed out the contribution room that grants were based from.",2021-02-27T06:11:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ltlyzz/bragging_about_resp/,

150c93p,Are people really that clueless about the reality of the lower class?,NoPistons7,Budget,4881,0.91,1092,"I keep seeing posts about what to do with such and such money because for whatever reason they came into some. 

The comments on the post though are what get me:
What is your family income?
How do you even survive on 75k a year with kids
You must be eating drywall to afford anything 

It goes on and on..... But the reality is that the lower class have no choice but to trudge forward, sometimes sacrificing bills to keep a roof over their head, or food in their kids stomachs. There is no ""woe is me I am going to curl up into a ball and cry"" you just do what needs to be done. You don't have time for self-pity, others depend on you to keep it level headed. 

I just see so many comments about how you cannot survive at all with less than $40k a year etc... Trust me there are people who survive with a whole hell of a lot less. 

I'm not blaming anyone but I'm trying to educate those who are well off or at least better off that the financially poor are not purposefully screwing over bills to smoke crack, we just have to decide some months what is more important, rent, food, or a phone bill, and yes as trivial as some bills may be, there has to be decisions on even the smallest bills. 

One example I saw recently, a family making $150k a year were asking for advice because they were struggling, now everyones situation is different obviously, but I found it interesting that some of their costs were similar to a person's post making $40k a year and he was managing, yet I keep thinking that if you told the family making $150k to survive on $40k they probably would explode.

Just my .2 cents. Sorry for the rant.

I find this charge absolutely bogus, especially since I haven't used my PayPal account in years (which I only created because sometime in the distant past, Ebay required me to).

When I saw this, I wanted to close my PayPal account in protest, but when I logged in, PayPal ""rewarded"" me for being a loyal customer with a $5 balance in my account. Oh great - but I still wanted to close my account.

Surprise surprise - PayPal wouldn't let me close my account unless my balance was $0 (now it's $5 thanks to their ""reward"").

Simple enough, just transfer the $5 to my bank account right? Nope - PayPal also has a $15 withdrawal minimum, meaning I can't withdraw my money unless I add-in more. 

I also couldn't cash out my balance to my credit cards - Neither my BMO, Tangerine or Desjardins mastecards are supported ""at this time"". 

This cumulation of obstacles by PayPal made me want to close my account \*even more\*. 

In the end, I just donated the $5 to a charity, just so that I could close my account once and for all.

But be aware - if you have a dormant PayPal account, be sure to close it, otherwise comes November, you might have a negative balance and PayPal has been known to send credit card chargebacks to collections, so who knows if they could send you to collections for having a negative balance too.

Stay far away from this excuse of a company. I wouldn't be surprised that they are already violating several consumer protection laws in Quebec, I don't know if they're federally regulated or are violating other provincial laws though.

lvuhw9,Lost my life savings,StupidMoronLoser,Investing,3868,0.94,897,"Dear reddit,

I am a long time reddit lurker but I am posting this under a new account because I don't want my identity to be known. I wrote the bulk of this comment before Christmas day but never got the courage to post it. I was encouraged by [Louis Rossman's comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGz8z_TG_F8) from two days ago on WSB so here I am. I'm making this post to ask for advice on what to do after being hit with a financial catastrophe that I brought upon myself. This is not easy to write but I am going to try.

The short of it is that I'm in my late forties, and I recently lost all my life savings, all my retirement savings, all the education savings for my children. This is about $220k. Now it's been reduced to about $2000. I have been in shock for the last year and I just don't see a way forward.

To give some background, I will tell you that my name appears on the Ontario sunshine list because I make a little over $100k a year. Despite being on this list, I live in a very modest rented apartment, the cheapest I could find in my area close to work. This is the kind of apartment you would feel embarrassed to invite anyone to. We have no central air conditioning in the summer. The kitchen is probably 30 years old. It's just a very modest apartment. We own one car and we always buy used every 10-15 years because I always try to spend as little as possible and I only buy what I can afford. I've always avoided debt. I never carry a balance on a credit card. I churn credit cards to earn rewards that I can save. I've never taken a vacation outside of Ontario even though I've always dreamed of lying on a beautiful sandy beach in Mexico or Cuba. My wife and I are both immigrants and we don't have any familial wealth to look forward to. My wife doesn't work because her English isn't very good and she doesn't have employable skills, so we decided she would be a stay at home mom for our two children and save on childcare costs.

When my children were born I immediately opened RESP accounts for them and started depositing $2.5k a year to get the maximum amount of RESP grant. One of these accounts had $50k at one point before everything went to hell.

In 2009 I was sitting in a coffee shop with a friend who mentioned in passing a leveraged ETF that follows the price of oil, HOU.TO. At that time I only bought broad index funds and bond fonds to be on the safe side. This ETF looked attractive to me because the price of oil was volatile at that time and traded in a predictable range for a while (between $90 and $120).

I started cautiously putting only 10-20% of my money into it. I made money for a couple of years, buying low and selling high. Then buying HOD.TO (which bets that the price is too high) when the price of oil was high and selling it when the price was low.

Meanwhile every year house prices here climbed ever higher and my children got older, and the apartment got more crowded. My wife's nagging got more frequent as she saw people we know living in big houses with nice furniture. I kept telling her that this is a bubble and it will pop. If we sold our investments to use as a down payment on a house, surely we would buy just before the bubble popped and we would lose our savings. Of course, as with everything else, I was so so wrong.

In 2014, the price of oil crashed. I was holding HOD.TO at the time and so I made a few thousand dollars when I sold when the price reached about $80. Life in our home was becoming unbearable because of the house issue. The urgency I felt for the need to make money to buy a house was high. So while sitting at a coffee shop one day, I made the disastrous decision to go all in and put all our money in HOU.TO in anticipation that the price of oil will rise again back to at least $100 as it had done the past few years.

Of course this time, the price did not go back up. The price kept going down and down and my sense of security along with it. By February 2015 I saw the value of my portfolio plummet by more than 90%.  I tried to stay calm in the hope that the price would go up and I would at least get my savings back. Don't sell at the bottom they tell you. I didn't sell and I was trapped.

Over the next few years I avoided logging into my brokerage account because I could not face the loss. The price slowly went up over the years. By mid 2019 I had recovered a little. My 90% loss was now a 60% loss. The value of my account was now about $90k. I wish I had sold then. But I didn't.

In March 2020 the price of oil started to nosedive again because of covid. When it reached $20 I thought (being the f\*\*\*ing idiot I am) that it can't go any lower and this is my chance to buy as much as I can at the bottom and hopefully I can recover my losses when the crisis is over in a few weeks time. So I bought HOU.TO again with my last $10k of savings. Within a couple of weeks the price of oil would turn negative and the price of HOU would go down another 95%.  By April, my quarter of a million dollars in savings, my nest egg, my children's university money, were reduced to about $2k - a soul-destroying 99% loss.

There's more. Since all the money was in registered savings accounts, I cannot claim them as a loss on my tax return. How stupid can one be?? ~~I've contemplated ending it all but what would my family do without me?!~~ (04/03/2021: after reading all your comments below I apologize for the previous sentence. It is ridiculous and unnecessary. I realize that now.)

I did not lose my job during the pandemic. I do not have debt. I do have a defined-benefits pension plan. But I am still renting because I missed my chance to buy a house. I wish I used the money as a down payment instead of investing. I used to read Garth Turner's blog years ago and it convinced me that the housing bubble pop was just around the corner, that I would be a fool to buy a house just before it popped. But it turned out I was the biggest fool of all.

Now I'm in my late 40s. I know that I have lost the game. I don't have enough time to save for retirement or buy a house. I will have to rent forever. I feel desperate. My marriage is falling apart. I look at successful people and then I look at myself with disgust for losing everything. I did it to myself.

As a desperate effort, I am posting this here as I am contemplating my miserable future, just in case someone has a good suggestion for me to follow. Maybe someone can recommend someone like a financial planner or something who can make a plan for me to recover from this disaster. I have lost all faith in my ability to make good financial decisions.

Excuse the incoherence of this lengthy post. It was hard to write and I wrote it over several weeks because it is very painful to face the reality of what I did. While I know it's a long shot that this post will result in anything to help me, maybe at least it will serve as a cautionary tale and save someone from ending up in my shoes.

I'm going to stop now. Please no mean replies. I fully realize how stupid I am and do not need it rubbed in my face.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 03/03/2021:**

Thank you everyone for your kind replies, comments, advice and PMs. I posted my comment 24 hours ago and logged in now, and your responses are overwhelming. I will go through them slowly but surely. I find it hard to spend more than a short time a day thinking about this because it brings me such anxiety and ruins my mood for the rest of the day.

For those who think that I will gamble again, I am now even hesitant to buy a broad index ETF. All the money I saved in the past year is sitting in cash until I have some kind of plan, which is why I posted my story, to get some input and feedback. I do feel tempted sometimes to buy a little Dogecoin or something but I won't spend more than $100 on such a thing. I have learned my lesson. Funny story: I bought one bitcoin for $20 in 2013 that I sold a few months later for $120 and thought that I made a good profit!

But what I have read so far and your personal experiences (thank you so much for sharing) make me feel hopeful that there is a way to recover, I just have to find it. I will post more questions as I go through your comments. I do have these questions though for now:

1. How do I go about finding a financial advisor that will give good advice and won't cost me hundreds of dollars more?
2. Is there any way to claim losses in RRSP, RESP or TFSA in my tax return? I didn't sell yet, that's another decision that I have to make.
3. Can you recommend a good mix of index ETFs to put future savings into?

**UPDATE 04/03/2021:**

I want to thank everyone who took the time to write a reply. My perspective is changing since reading all the comments here. Today was actually a good day where I didn't feel awful about this. I feel like a heavy weight is lifting. Thank you. I am still reading all the replies and processing. If I don't reply to your post in person and thank you, please know that I am grateful to each and everyone of you.

I also wanted to clear some things up regarding my wife:

1. I did try to involve her in the financial decisions but investing is not something she knows much about, so it was left to me to take care of.  I did tell her what happened a few months ago. She was devastated at first when she realized her dreams were wrecked, but over the last few months she has adjusted her expectations and she is supportive and understanding now.
2. Also, to be fair, she did try to find work. 4 years ago she started taking courses in a discipline that she's good at and she studied hard and earned a couple of certificates. Then she went to a couple of interviews but because she was not fluent it did not work out. Then covid happened and the chances of her finding work evaporated as someone who hasn't worked for years and has no Canadian work experience. She is waiting until things go back to normal and there are more job opportunities. Meanwhile she is working on improving her skills at home.

Thank you all.",2021-03-02T00:10:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/lvuhw9/lost_my_life_savings/,

th40a0,My mom is still pressuring me to add me as a third person on her new $820k mortgage. I really don’t want to as my husband and I are looking to buy our own home. She states doing this will build my credit for a new mortgage down the line,,Housing,3505,0.94,699,"My (25f) mother (60f) and her boyfriend (60f), had a house in Ottawa which was a nice home. She’s always hated the home for reasons I think could have easily been renovated example: new shower tiles, new doors, or adding basic finishes to the basement. It was a new build at the time (2017).. I as well as the mortgage advisor advised against it given that the new home she wanted went for $820k and she still had quite a-lot left on her mortgage. In the end, the bank pre approved her and her boyfriend for $500k with the knowledge that the rest of the fees will be covered using the profit from her old home.

Fast forward to now, she keeps asking me to come on as a third person given that with my good job and with a salary of over $65k, the pre approval amount will be higher. The issue is I am now married and my husband and I are also saving up to buy a home in the next few years. She dismissed it and said doing this with her will build my credit and when im ready to buy a home the bank will approve me and she will definitely co-sign with us (is this a thing?).. because she went and told her mortgage advisor that im interested but I don’t think she gave her the details. 

Not only that, I’m pregnant and will be going on maternity leave which means that it’s not the time to think about things like this because I will technically be on employment insurance which is exactly why my husband and I are waiting until I get back to work and he gains more seniority in his work. 

Im at a loss on what to do because my mom has screwed me over for small amounts of money so that alone i don’t trust. But it’s the fact she’s already telling the mortgage advisor I want in and she’s disregarding the fact that I’m married with her own grand kid on the way.. however, she did state doing this will build my credit and it will be easier to qualify for a new mortgage down the line with my husband.",2022-03-18T11:30:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/th40a0/my_mom_is_still_pressuring_me_to_add_me_as_a/,

zai4cj,update about loosing my job after the financing was finalized but before taking possession on a home,,Housing,3031,0.95,385,"A few months back I posted from another throwaway (since deleted so I can’t link the post) about losing my job between the time the financing was fully approved and the date the sale actually closed. At that time I was asking if the funder would be likely to re-check my employment status on or before the closing date, or if I should just keep quiet and hope no one found out. I wanted to report back because I had some mixed reactions on that post. 

I went with the advice of not mentioning losing my job since most people said it would be very unusual for them to check my employment again at that stage. I’m happy to report that those people were correct. I was able to close and take possession with no issue; I just didn’t mention to anyone that I had lost my job. To the one person who said they couldn’t wait to see it blow up in my face when I had a mortgage and no job to pay for it, I’m especially happy to report to you that I got a job offer the day I took possession of the house and the wage is the exact same for less hours of work, so I’m good. I had 3 months pay as a termination package from my previous job and I started my new job within 1 month, so I actually came out ahead by 2 months pay. My partner would have been able to cover our mortgage alone anyway but luckily they didn’t have to. 

So yeah, it’s all good. The deal went through and we’re all settled in our new house. As most of you predicted they did not reconfirm my employment at closing. I got a new job basically immediately which pays the same as the old job so everything worked out.


Edit- I just figured out how to edit! Changed loosing to losing. I can’t change the title though so we’re all just going to have to live with that mistake.

She seems to be under the impression that she is obligated to buy presents to the point that she's taking on thousands in high interest debt.

Please don't do this. Credit card debt is a finance ruiner. It's so hard to climb out of when you let it build up. It makes it so hard to build wealth when you have a bunch of credit card debt. It really is OK to tell your friends and family that you are dealing with some financial pressure this year and can't do fancy presents. If they're worth talking to, they'll totally understand. Bake some Christmas goodies or make something simple to show your loved ones you care. It'll mean more than an expensive widget anyways. If you have kids, put together what you can for them. Even if this coworker returned everything and only spent a couple hundred on their kids, the situation would be so much better.

No doubt there is pressure to spend money this time of year, but ultimately it is up to you to give in. Look at your budget and be smart about it. The presents will likely be forgotten long before your bank account recovers.

If a TFSA holder passes away, that TFSA transfers to the spouse with no tax implications, and does not impact their TFSA room (so effectively, the surviving spouse could have double the room).  Note that naming a spouse as a beneficiary doesn't work like this, you need to select successor holder.

A Beneficiary receives the contents of of the TFSA, and then the TFSA is shut down.  The contribution room is lost.

pkyjgh,Noticed a huge trend of young Canadians leaving Canada for better opportunities /housing in the US,pras5,,2668,0.85,1331,"A lot of young Canadian professionals in tech and healthcare are moving to the states due to low wages in Canada compared to the cost of living. 

In the united states you can make double the wage of someone in Canada in tech or healthcare. In additional, housing (depending on the state) is cheaper. 

My friends and I are in the process and moving out of Canada to the united states for higher wage jobs and better housing. We have noticed a huge wave of young Canadian professionals are moving as well.

One recruiter told me she transferred 40 doctors and 60 software developers  out of Canada to work higher wage jobs in the United States. 

I think will this will be an issue for the Canadian government as they will lose a lot of tax revenue and they deserve it as well. The past government agencies have had terrible housing  policies for housing and lack attention towards young Canadians needs. 

I think the boomer generation will need young Canadians  to foot the bill for their OAS and  GIS and right now they are leaving for better opportunities outside of Canada.

lcf3uc,"The boring, foolproof, non-financial financial advice everyone overlooks",,Budget,2627,0.93,537,"
Apologies for the clickbait title but rest assured, there’s no scam here. I’ve come up with a list of time-tested, foolproof ways to save money that are infinitely more reliable than whatever investment scheme you’re cooking up. And speaking of cooking:

1. Learn to cook

Doordash, ubereats, skip-the-dishes, delete them from your phone. Learn to cook rice, vegetables and inexpensive proteins like beans, chicken, pork, tofu, chickpeas etc. Does your food need more flavour? Buy some salt, pepper and garlic. That’s all it takes to start. Is your food over/under done? But a meat thermometer. Stop buying $10 lunches and $3 coffees. I used to buy $3 coffee every day. That’s $60 a month ($90 if weekends are included) On COFFEE. I bought a $50 coffee maker and it paid itself off in 2 months. Now I’ve owned it for 3 years. 

2. Take care of your teeth

Brush twice a day. Try to do the same with flossing, but no one ever does it, so try to start once a week. You know why dentists make so much money? You know why they see your mouth as a goldmine? Because you won’t be able to put up with your painful, busted ass teeth for your whole life and you’re going to need them fixed. Taking care of your teeth cuts down on the amount of times over your life that you’ll wake up in the morning going “ow, my tooth hurts, wonder why” and then suddenly you’re out $500... or $2000...

3. Prioritize the importance of your physical belongings and take care of them accordingly

Do you need a flashy, expensive (or even mid-range car) to impress clients at your job? No? Then it’s OK to drive a beater. Do you need a suit for work? No? Then it’s OK to buy your daily workwear from somewhere like Costco or Walmart. Those are your low-priority items. If you rip a hole in your $10 work shirt, you can probably afford to throw it out. 

However, the flip side of that is, if you need to have a suit or nice car on-hand... TAKE CARE OF THEM. Don’t wear your nice suit and dress shoes out in a snowstorm... don’t skip the oil change on the car. If you’re tech savvy, you can keep your beater smartphone or laptop meeting your needs for a long time. Do you need a top-of-the-line gaming rig? If so, spend the money on long-lasting parts (I.e. CPU), and take care of your rig; clean it regularly, watch the temps, try not to get malware. I’m still wearing a jacket I bought 10 years ago. 

4. Other tips and tricks

Buy long-lasting footwear - it’s insanely easy to spend a lot of money on cheaply-made, branded (and completely awful) footwear. I’m looking at you, Jordan’s. Buy some decent sneakers and hiking boots and rotate them around accordingly

Get away from Instagram/FB if you’re in circles where people try to promote their belongings, flex or look like they can afford a lifestyle they probably can’t. Way too many people go into debt trying to look fresh on Instagram. Don’t get sucked in. Speaking of debt...

Pay off your credit cards - Credit card companies make their money off you not realizing how much 20% interest really is

**Edit** Wow thanks for the feedback folks! Some really great tips in the comments too (esp. liked the one about taking care of your KIDS teeth, in addition to your own!)

And to clarify re #3, I’m definitely not saying “don’t spend money on luxuries that make you happy”. What I am saying is, if (when) you spend money on luxuries, TAKE CARE OF THEM!

Bought some fancy-ass dress shoes you like? Realize you’re wearing $700 on your feet and walking through puddles isn’t a great idea. Bought the new $2000 MacBook Air? Maybe keep your un-covered drinks away from it. Finally saved up for that Lexus? Slap some snow tires on that baby and make sure you have some decent insurance. Nice new phone? Yeah? Buy the case! If you decide to go all out, don’t skimp out, just spend your money where it creates (or protects) the most value.

**Edit 2** Obligatory “I am not a financial advisor” but here’s some other tips to address some complaints from offended individuals that this isn’t real financial advice: 

1. You likely don’t need balance protection insurance on your credit card - It’s notoriously difficult to successfully file a claim and the coverages are much narrower in scope than they are sold as

2. If your bank waives account fees for carrying a minimum balance, look into getting the best account you can (e.g. a “TD all inclusive” account provides free cheques, money orders, safety deposit box etc. And is free if you maintain a $5,000 minimum balance)

3. You only need overdraft protection if you **regularly** dip into overdraft (e.g. if it’s unavoidable based on your income cycle). If it only happens once in a while, the individual ding is likely still cheaper than total cost of the protection. 

4. When shopping for a mortgage, don’t overlook credit unions. A massive component of a lot of credit unions’ business is lending, especially residential mortgage and small business lending. Credit unions can offer rates far more competitive than banks, even to non-members

5. If you’re thinking about investing and can stomach some short-term volatility, look into Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) - bundles of diversified securities issued by major financial institutions. Many sector-specific ETFs (including Oil/Gas, Real Estate and Finance) still haven’t recovered from COVID and it might be worth your while to look into them. COVID recession aside though, ETFs can be reliable, income-generating instruments

6. Financing can be a reasonable option if you’re trying to manage cashflow, but generally speaking it is better to outright buy something you can currently afford rather than finance it. Cars especially.

**Edit** - Last one, I promise

7. Protect your credit score! It’s not just a number, it’s your key to reliable, low-interest credit (which you’re going to need if you ever want to buy a house, or even just open a line of credit). Tanking your credit score and limiting yourself to alternative lending “solutions” is a very dangerous, slippery slope.",2021-02-04T07:59:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/lcf3uc/the_boring_foolproof_nonfinancial_financial/,

Hello, again. I'm the one who made the post a couple days ago about median male income being down in Canada

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/otwiuf/the\_average\_male\_income\_in\_canada\_has\_gone\_down/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/otwiuf/the_average_male_income_in_canada_has_gone_down/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I was surprised by the amount of cope in the thread arguing ways our lives have gotten better. I've decided to compile in one post some resources outlining how that's not the case.

First, overall median income is still down, though mostly flat since 1976.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.3&pickMembers%5B2%5D=3.1&pickMembers%5B3%5D=4.3&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1976&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2019&referencePeriods=19760101%2C20190101](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110023901&pickMembers%5B0%5D=1.1&pickMembers%5B1%5D=2.3&pickMembers%5B2%5D=3.1&pickMembers%5B3%5D=4.3&cubeTimeFrame.startYear=1976&cubeTimeFrame.endYear=2019&referencePeriods=19760101%2C20190101)

Second, although people are broadly aware of the meme ""stagnant wages"", it's apparent to me that most people don't realize how much of a calamity this is. Until the 1970s living standards had been steadily increasing across the West. For that to change is a massive reversal.

[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-Builders-Day-Wages-from-1200-to-2000\_fig1\_247816806](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Real-Builders-Day-Wages-from-1200-to-2000_fig1_247816806)

In the 25 years before 1976 real wages increased 2.5x in Canada.

[http://ccsd.ca/factsheets/fs\_avgin.html](http://ccsd.ca/factsheets/fs_avgin.html)

Third, this has been at the same time as average education has skyrocketed. For overall wages to stay flat as you need more and more education to achieve that outcome is a decrease in your quality of life.

[https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/esdc-edsc/migration/images/eng/standards\_equity/eq/pubs\_eq/eedr/2011/images/fig3.jpg](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/esdc-edsc/migration/images/eng/standards_equity/eq/pubs_eq/eedr/2011/images/fig3.jpg)

Fourth, the cost of education has massively increased in real terms. This is on top of the fact you need more of it just to stand still.

[https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/sites/ca.canadian-index-wellbeing/files/uploads/images/image011.png](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/sites/ca.canadian-index-wellbeing/files/uploads/images/image011.png)

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-004-x/2006001/chrt/cost.gif](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/81-004-x/2006001/chrt/cost.gif)

Fifth, the quality of jobs has gone down. For instance, your boss always expects to reach you on e-mail now. The % of people in contract work has skyrocketed.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-631-x/2018001/c-g20-eng.png](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-631-x/2018001/c-g20-eng.png)

Sixth, pensions have faded away. Not only do fewer overall people have a pension, but the % of those with a defined-benefit plan is down too.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14120/c-g/c-g02-eng.gif](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2014001/article/14120/c-g/c-g02-eng.gif)

Finally I come to housing. The issue's been hammered to death so I won't obsess over the figures only add a few lesser-discussed points. Home ownership is basically not included in CPI. As a result, incomes staying flat while housing costs skyrocket is a disaster for living standards. Rents have gone up well above inflation as well, it's not like if you rent you've been unaffected.

Because home prices have skyrocketed more and more people are living with their parents. That's a very real decline in your living standards vs your grandparents.

[https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2016001/article/14639-eng.htm](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75-006-x/2016001/article/14639-eng.htm)

Commute times have also gone up, that's another very real decrease in your quality of life due to increased cost of housing.

[https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/what-we-do/domains-and-indicators/mean-workday-commute-time-individuals-working-pay](https://uwaterloo.ca/canadian-index-wellbeing/what-we-do/domains-and-indicators/mean-workday-commute-time-individuals-working-pay)

Finally, the argument that mortgage payments haven't changed that much doesn't hold water. Interest rates were so high because inflation was so high, they're directly related. A mortgage is defined by having a flat payment in nominal terms for all 25-30 years. As a result, the higher inflation means the real payment you have to make decreases remarkably quickly if there's high inflation. You may have a similar payment to start, but in real terms a few years out the payment is much lower.

All of this combined means we've seen a drastic decline in the quality of our lives for a given level of education/occupation. That isn't typical on a post-industrial revolution time frame. The graph I gave of 1,000 years of UK data was for the same job.

Doing more of the same would be insane. If you've benefited you should feel guilty. If you've had influence on policy you should be ashamed. The other guy being worse doesn't cut it.",2021-08-01T11:57:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ovuoks/quality_of_life_has_materially_gone_down_in/,

weh2c1,Landlord posted rental ad for my suite for next month when I still have 6 months left on the lease. In the ad it states Indian applicants only.,spatiul,,2423,0.96,212,"

I live in a basement suite below some other tenants who are related to the landlord. They are an Indian couple, along with the landlord, which doesn’t really matter except for the fact the landlord posted an ad a couple days ago (I still frequent rentals to see how the market is) and stated they are looking for an Indian tenant.

I have not gotten any notice or anything about this. The ad is definitely new and updated, with a move in date of October 1st.

I texted the landlord to ask what the deal was over 24 hours ago. No reply yet. My call this morning was iced.

I’ve had zero conflict with the upstairs people (as far as I know?), I run a tight ship and keep the common areas clean. Rent always on time. I asked them once if they wanted to go for coffee and they declined, so since then I just don’t keep much contact with them. They have friends over very often so I just assume they don’t care much for me (which is fine).

The whole application process was a bit different than what I’m used to; asking my religion practice, single/married; my food choices; how many guests I expect to have; etc.

I do like the unit as it’s very close to my work and it’s new, but if I’m seriously getting evicted over my colour of skin I am happy to tell these guys to fuck off.

Just wondering if I’m protected or not as a tenant. In Alberta.

k3c9l8,How to recognize e-transfer scams,,,2416,0.98,259,"I hope this post is allowed. I work for one of the Big 5. I have 3 years of experience in a specialized e-transfer team. I've spoken to thousands of victims and perpetrators of fraud and scams. I'm so sick and sad of seeing my customers become victim to various different scams. If I can help at least one person with this, I'd be so happy. Interac e-transfer is an amazing service when used right and there are ways to protect yourself. 

I will tell you about scams I see, the red flags, how to protect yourself and I will score the resolution to the issue on a scale of 1 to 10. 1 being ""You're screwed"" and 10 being ""It's like nothing happened.""

**Types of Scams**


I. *Job Scams*

Usually a victim will get reached out to on a job site (indeed, LinkedIn, or even through their e-mail). The scammers will pose as an employer offering a clean yearly salary with benefits for sitting on your butt and accepting e-transfers and then sending them out to someone else or withdrawing the funds at an atm to be deposited at a bitcoin machine.

The e-transfers they send you will be fraudulently sent from another victims account and you will now be flagged with your bank for accepting fraudulent money. You will be blocked with e-transfers.

Red Flags:

- You didn't apply for this job
- Little to no information about the company online
- A too good to be true salary
- They ask if you can accept e-transfers 
- They ask how much money you can withdraw at an ATM
- The etransfer they send is from a different name or company 
- They tell you your task is to deposit money to a bitcoin machine in a sketchy corner store

How to protect yourself:

- Proof. SAVE EVERYTHING. Job offers, Emails, bitcoin receipts, text messages. If you have sufficient proof, your bank should be able to protect you and allow you to continue with the Interac service.
- Be skeptical and call your bank if you're unsure about a deposit to your account.

General Resolution Score:

 7/10. Assuming you have enough proof for me to show Interac that you were a victim, we should be okay in about an afternoon. If you don't, expect to be blocked from Interac for at LEAST 12 months.


II. *Puppy Scams*

You're thinking of getting a puppy and you think you've found a reputable seller on Kijiji. They have a website and certificates. They collect a deposit from you for the puppy. Later they ask you for payment for shipping the puppy to you.
Then you can't call them, they aren't responding to their messages. You start to feel like there never was a puppy... and you're right. (You can also replace puppy for whatever service or product you're buying)

Red Flags:

- They're shipping the puppy from far away and won't meet with you
- They ask for a deposit of a large amount
- They are weirdly unenthusiastic about the dog (I mean, its a puppy, cmon..)
- Super rare or popular breeds
- They ask you to send the etransfers to two different recipients
- They stop responding

How to protect yourself:

- Proof again is important here, but for a different reason. We want that proof to show interac that this was a Scam transfer.
- Call your bank and ask them to flag the transfer and block the recipient from the Interac service. Once it is sent from the account it is VERY difficult to recover and is not guaranteed.

General Resolution Score: 

2/10. We might get your money back... maybe... might.... again its difficult. And because you sent the money out of your account willingly, its not covered as fraud. So no money and no puppy. So shitty.


III. *Shitty Friends lmao*

Some of you people just have really bad friends, for real. If your friend asks you to accept an etransfer for them, tell them to go fuck themselves. If they can't accept etransfers,  there's a really good reason for that usually.
You don't know how many conversations I've had about these that start with ""Well, they're in jail now but..."". Fuck being nice. Do NOT accept etransfers for anyone else. Consider this the 21st century bad cheque scam.

Red Flags:

- Your friend can't accept etransfers with their bank or they don't have a bank
- You don't know who is sending them that transfer 
- The transfer isn't even made out to their name

How to protect yourself:

- IF you accept a transfer for someone else, get them to send you an email or text message requesting you accept it. Even then, that might not be enough proof.
- Be prepared to be blocked from Interac for at least 12 months and forced to pay back any loss to the bank. 

General Resolution Score: 

2/10. You'll be blocked with Interac for at least 12 months.



IV. [*Intercepted Transfers*](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/k3wk00/intercepted_etransfers_and_why_theyre_the_worst/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

By far the most common scam right now. You send an etransfer with a security question to your landlord, friend, or even your wife. You've done it hundreds of times before and there's never been an issue. You get the notification that its been deposited, but the intended recipient doesn't have it. Wait... what? Your bank says it was deposited to someone who neither you or the recipient know.

Before I get into the red flags, I want to explain what happened. Youre getting lazy with your security questions. And the person you were sending the etransfer to? Either their email is compromised or they have spyware or malware on their devices. The compromise in the devices leaves a nice opportunity for someone to take advantage of your landlords/friends/whomevers email and take their money. Its impossible to have this intercepted from the sending end. This is really unfortunate for the recipient and the sender, but I find the recipients are taking NO responsibility for their compromised emails.

Red Flags:

- The recipient says they have the notification but can't accept the transfer as it says its already deposited.
- Your security question is too easy. It genuinely needs to be something only you and they know
- If the recipient emails you to ask the answer to the security question, DO NOT EMAIL BACK. Call them.

How to protect yourself:

- Better security questions
- Better yet, Auto-Deposit for EVERYONE
- Call your bank to flag the transfer as intercepted

General Resolution Score: 1.25/10

Again. Its hard to get your money back once its deposited. We will try our level best but the onus is kinda on the recipient here. They need urgent help for their devices and e-mail.



V. *Bad Deposit Transfers*


A fraudster could deposit a bad cheque and with the funds not put on hold, they can send an e-transfer. Once that cheque bounces, its now called a Bad Deposit Transfer. It gets flagged with the sender AND the recipient if you'd believe it! Interac can't be sure whether you two are in on it together. This is the equivalent of kiting cheques but with etransfers.

How to protect yourself:

- If your card stops working after accepting a transfer, call them. It may be because of a bad deposit e-transfer.
- The sender, whether it was you from another bank or another person  has to contact the bank where the etransfer originated from and work out the bad deposit.

General Resolution Score:

5/10. Depends on how quickly the sender can pay back the bad deposit. Once that is done, the bank will consider the whole bank relationship before reinstating with Interac.



VI. *Kijiji/Product and Service Scams*

Friends, I'm sure this is surprising but Kijiji does not want you using etransfers. You have no idea how much grief it causes them. Accepting an etransfer for a product or service on kijiji or otherwise can be a risky thing. Again, I bring up that Interac e-transfers should be used with people we know and trust.

You're selling an item online, you agree to meet up with someone, they agree to buy and they send you an etransfer. Amazing. A couple days later your bank card is blocked, and your bank is MAD. They said you scammed someone? What the heck? They took the item didn't they? They didn't tell you the product was broken or defective...

Red Flags:
- I wish I could tell you what these would be. A lot of the customers I talk to are like they were totally fine and didn't talk to me after I sold it 
- People are weird and shitty

How to protect yourself:

- Proof! Show me the texts, the emails, the conversations of you agreeing to meet and the email they're sending the transfer to. Take a picture of them with the item!


General Resolution Score: 
7/10 these are easy. Give me the proof and we're good.

In the case of people who send the money before getting the item, and go to pick it up with nothing, see puppy scam. Same thing.




**My General Tips**

- [Autodeposit always](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/k4m2c6/in_defense_of_interac_autodeposit/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)
- Set up auto deposit with a new email, and only give that email to people you know and trust to avoid unwanted autodeposits.
- If we can't do autodeposit, give a VERY DIFFICULT SECURITY QUESTION
- Only send and receive from people you know and trust
- Do NOT accept etransfers that were sent to your friend
- Do NOT accept any etransfers you don't recognize.
- Change your passwords and security questions regularly, and don't give them to your partner, parent, kid, friend, no matter how much you trust and love them
- Trust your instincts. A lot of my customers say, ""I felt like it was weird but I still did it..""

And that's about what I've got right now. If anyone has any questions I'm here and happy to answer.

Thanks for reading! Keep safe!

(E: never thought I'd be the girl to do this BUT THANK YALL FOR THE AWARDS AND THE GOLD)

(E: I appreciate your guys' healthy skepticism towards the e-transfer service but I won't be responding to any messages or comments that criticize it too heavily. I didnt invent etransfers so it doesn't bug me but I can really only speak on this service because its what I know. I am wary of being identified by coworkers or my employer and you won't catch me slippin.

The least you can admit about e-transfers is that it fills a need that the banks otherwise weren't meeting and its convenient in that sense.)",2020-11-29T11:31:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/k3c9l8/how_to_recognize_etransfer_scams/,

Living in toronto my whole life I know things are expensive but on my walk I saw that 1 scoop of ice cream at Baskin robins is $5 plus tax. (so $5.65).

I get that rent, cost of ingredients and labour is more expensive here but there's no way it's 4.3 times as expensive. Plus, I know how much ice cream costs at the grocery store and there is no way a scoop costs more than 50 cents at wholesale.

Is it just that ice cream stores in Canada have higher profit margins? Or is it because Canadians are willing to pay 5 dollars for a scoop?

m3gg6r,I can't believe I've been paying someone to do my taxes my whole life,_souldier,Taxes,2253,0.96,610,"My whole life I have believed the lie that filing your own taxes is far too tedious and complicated to do on your own and is best left to the professionals. I was given the idea that it will take hours to do, and I can easily make mistakes that will get me in trouble, lead to a lower refund or taxes owing, etc.

This year I mustered enough courage to file my own taxes online using a free platform. I was shocked that I was done in less than an hour, it was extremely simple, and I got the same refund I would expect if I had gone to an accountant. If I were to do it again, I could literally finish in 15 minutes or less. Granted my situation is simple... t5, donations, rrsp, etc. I went to the accountant thinking it would save me time and headache... I saved way more time (and money) doing my taxes in the comfort of my own home.

I'm probably preaching to the choir here but if there is anyone out there who still pays someone to do their taxes and doesn't have an overly complicated tax situation, do yourself a favor and file your own taxes online for free.

15lil7j,Report realtor to CRA?,Dry_Age2213,Housing,2226,0.95,567,"Hi everyone! I purchased a house two years ago, during the height of Covid overbidding and all of that fun stuff. The seller both owned the house and represented themselves as the realtor as well. At the time, they told me that they had gotten a job in another city and simply couldn’t do the commute, hence the sale. Fine, none of my business really…I had always suspected it was a flip, but we loved the house and area.

Fast forward to this week, a video popped up on my TikTok feed of said realtor talking about how they had made over 200k on their first flip, and low and behold - it was our house! Learned some interesting details from the vid (way way overpaid for trades), but in the comments, a user had asked them about how they avoided paying capital gains on the sale. They fully admitted to putting the house as their primary residence “on paper only”. The length of time between when they purchased and sold was only really 4 months.

Is it worth reporting her to the CRA as having potentially skirted paying capital gains tax? It seemed like they went on to do a bunch of flips after this one too, and had made millions in turn. Im worried about anonymity if reporting.

EDIT: I went ahead and reported the Realtor to the CRA. Let them handle it and do whatever they do. For those of you saying I’m only doing this because I overpaid - I completely accept the overpayment, it was what it was! I have an issue with scumbag Realtors who skirt the rules and frankly make the housing situation for everyone way worse while expecting a hefty commission.",2023-08-08T09:41:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/15lil7j/report_realtor_to_cra/,

It's the second month in a row of lost jobs, coming on the heels of 43,000 jobs lost in June. Economists had been expecting the economy to eke out a slight gain of about 15,000 jobs, but instead the employment pool shrank.

Most of the losses came in the service sector, which lost 53,000 positions. That was offset by a gain of 23,000 jobs in goods-producing industries.

Despite the decline, the jobless rate held steady at its record low of 4.9 per cent, because while there were fewer jobs, there were fewer people looking for work, too.

vzham2,Kids do not provide a good ROI if you’re depending on them for retirement,,Investing,2154,0.92,403,"Over 22 years at 12k per year, if you invested that money, it would’ve turned into 641k at 7% a year. That’s 25.6k a year using the 4% rule.

mkbrn6,"Just bought my first house, $12,000 in Northern NB.",frugalboididit,Housing,2121,0.95,383,"My upstairs is only accessible by a ladder and my well water is brown but it’s a house. I bought it with $4000 down and the remainder owner financed with the agreement I’d do lawn care and snow removal for the seller who lives next door. 

The plan is to pay it off ASAP and then work on making it liveable. It needs a lot of work but it beats renting, even in northern NB my rent was $700/month where as I’m currently paying $200/month for the “mortgage” and my property tax is $625/year.

There’s a few issues, I can’t insure the place and the only working heat the moment is a wood stove. But, the power is still connected and they didn’t ask many questions when I switched it to my name so that’s a bonus.

I’m currently making $14/hr and getting 35-45 hours a week. I plan on growing most of my own food this summer and hopefully bag a deer or two in the fall. Similar “nice” houses in the area have sold for $70,000 so I hope with a few years of work I can refinance, divide the lot and start building a second better house using ICF so I can do most of the work myself. 

I’m currently living on less than $600 (not including the payments on the house) a month, which includes insurance on a 1988 F150 and gas, food, a $65/month phone plan and an estimated $90/month power bill. 

This isn’t a life style for everyone, but at 22 I’m ok with roughing it, it feels like I’m camping. My goal is to save as much money as possible the next 8 years, sell the houses then spend 2-3 years backpacking around the world.

Edit: People are asking for more information about the house. 

It’s a 1.5 story home on a 7’ dirt floor basement built in either 55 or 65 I’m not sure. It’s a 2 bed 1 bath and is roughly 1100 square feet not including the basement.

The lot is 2.2 acre with about .5 acre landscaped the rest is treed. It’s about 25-30 minutes outside of Grandfalls NB. 

The nearest gas station is about 7 minutes away, it has all the basics, the nearest grocery store is about 25 minutes away in Grandfalls, where the hospital, schools and so on are. 

It’s on it’s own well and septic system. Has a 100 amp electrical service. The windows and aluminum siding are original, so are the doors and most of the interior. According to the seller he paid to have the roof done in 2015. He had plans of moving into the home but he can no longer travel up and down stairs. 

The stairs were removed, the second floor is only accessible by ladder, the kitchen had a fridge and stove but the faucet for the sink is missing. 

It’s a lot like camping but I figure in a year or so and about $5000 I can have it looking like a normal house unless I run into major issues with the well.",2021-04-04T23:35:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/mkbrn6/just_bought_my_first_house_12000_in_northern_nb/,

zg4hzn,CRTC rejects Telus’ request to charge credit card processing fee for regulated home telephone services,seakucumber,Misc,2105,0.98,127,"CRTC warns telecommunications companies against this practice

December 8, 2022 – Ottawa-Gatineau – Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC)

Today, the CRTC refused Telus’s request to introduce a processing fee in Alberta and British Columbia on payments made by credit card. The request only applied to services that are regulated by the CRTC, which are generally home telephone services in certain smaller communities.

On October 17, 2022, Telus began to charge a 1.5% fee to clients paying by credit card in areas where services are not regulated by the CRTC, which includes its wireless and Internet customers outside of Quebec.

While Telus didn’t need the CRTC’s approval to add the surcharge to its unregulated services, the CRTC is very concerned about this practice as it goes against affordability and consumer interest. In addition, this practice impacts the most vulnerable consumers who rely on credit cards to pay their everyday bills, especially when prices for essential goods and services are rising due to inflation.

The CRTC is sending a clear message to Telus and other telecommunications service providers that are thinking of imposing such a fee on their customers. Should the practice continue, the CRTC will explore all available regulatory options.

“We heard Canadians loud and clear: close to 4,000 of you told us that you should not be subjected to an additional fee based on the method you choose to pay your bill. We expect the telecommunications industry to treat Canadians with respect and do better.”

- Ian Scott, Chairperson and Chief Executive Officer, CRTC

wt65oc,Warning: Hyundai dealers insist on a fee for end-of-lease purchase,dogswanttobiteme,Auto,2091,0.97,428,"You do not need to pay those if they are not in your contract.

I’m in Ontario.

My lease is just about ended and I was planning to purchase the car. My dealer Dixie Hyundai insisted on adding a $999 fee for the “service”. 

I called Hyundai Milton - their fee was $299.


They all insisted it was non-negotiable, and that everyone pays it, or that it’s a fee that the dealership charges separately and that’s why it’s not in the contract. I spoke with various finance sales managers.

To buy out, you have to bring them a cashier’s check for the buyout amount they tell you, which included their made up fee, and if you don’t, then they won’t do the purchase. Time is also working against you.

It’s a scam.

I called Hyundai Canada and Hyundai Motors Finance (turns out those are different companies) - they both agreed that there shouldn’t be any extra fee. The customer service rep said that they would contact the dealer, and they gave me a 10 days grace period on the lease, but that’s the only thing they could do. The latter gave me a case number.

A few days later, I received a call from Dixie Hyundai (I think his name was Sayed) saying that they heard from Hyundai Canada rep and that they “want to help me out” with a discounted fee of $529 (where the fuck do they pull those numbers from). I laughed at his face - first for the made up discount and second that his discounted fee was higher than the original made up fee at Hyundai Milton. He used this opportunity to say “see, all dealerships charge a fee”. He also alluded that I’m in a no win situation because my lease is ending.

Anyway, he said he’d call back, but never did. 

I called Hyundai Motors Finance again. They said that they’ve been trying to reach the dealer but that it’s hard and the dealer doesn’t always pick up the phone. It’s honestly a ridiculous situation. The customer service rep said that she will continue trying.

Eventually, I received a call from Drew who is a GM at Dixie Hyundai. He apologized, and said something to the effect that some contracts have changed and that the people I spoke with didn’t know that, and something about that it’s not how the dealer “should keep the lights on”.

TLDR: dealer insisted on a fee to purchase the car at the end of the lease. The fees are completely made up by each dealer. I did not agree despite pressure to pay any fee not in contract. Contacted Hyundai Motors Finance - the contract is with them. They eventually reached a GM and now it’s about to be resolved.",2022-08-20T08:40:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/wt65oc/warning_hyundai_dealers_insist_on_a_fee_for/,

1llcrdn,Never thought I'd enjoy living in a townhouse,Best_Confidence_1022,Housing,2042,0.96,257,"
My wife and I bought a 4 bedroom townhouse in April 2021. We've since had a child who is now 3 years old.

At the time we could only afford a townhouse but thought we could live in it for 7-8 years and then upgrade to a detached. I then got so caught up in crazily monitoring home prices and forgot to live in the house. Combined with the stress of raising a baby, this took a huge toll on my relationship and last year my wife said it HAD to stop.

I then realized I never even lived in this house. There was literally no effort put into making it a home because I was obsessed with a 'dream home' without realizing what I already have. Mortgage payment is comfortable, we bought within our means and are fortunate to have good jobs. And in the past year we've now put in effort to actually make this our home and it's made such a difference in my outlook. 

Yes I don't have a large front yard or a huge backyard. I don't have a big basement. But I have 4 rooms which is more than enough for us, especially since we don't want more kids. The townhouses are newly built and I can barely hear noise from my neighbors. I pay a small maintenance fee yes but I don't have to worry about landscaping or snow removal or visitor parking. The townhouses around me are full of young families so my kid has company and it's a very community feel.

We are not handy at all and hear about home issues some of our friends in detached houses have to deal with, especially those who bought older houses. Maybe this home size and type is perfect for us.

I'm not saying it's perfect but I feel bad that I took so long to realize what I have. We may still move in 5 years but I'm glad I realized the value of my home before it was too late.",2025-06-26T17:50:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1llcrdn/never_thought_id_enjoy_living_in_a_townhouse/,

In May, the rate of inflation reached a 39-year-high of 7.7 per cent. Economists had largely expected inflation to rise above eight per cent in the June print. As the cost of living has continued to rise, wages in Canada are lagging, rising 5.2 per cent in June on a year-over-year basis. Last week, the Bank of Canada hiked its key interest rate by a full percentage point in an effort to slow skyrocketing inflation. The rate hike was the largest single increase in more than 20 years.

qoqdq9,"My landlord wants to pay me to leave my apartment ($20,000)",Pseudo2024,,2004,0.94,680,"Hello all,

I live in Victoria, British Columbia and my landlord has just offered me to leave my apartment by the end of the year for $20,000. He is also offering to pay the movers.

I pay about 1100$ a month to live in a nice neighborhood and my building is on the waterfront. The amount I am paying is below the market price. I hardly see how accepting it could be a benefit. I think my landlords are losing between $11,000 and $16,000 a year. They have done a lot of renovations in the building and I know they have raised the prices a lot. I don't know exactly how much, but the price of a two-bedroom in Victoria is between $2200 and $2500 a month now. Maybe more?

If I accept the amount, I could never find a rental that cheap and of good quality. After 1-2 years, the $20,000 will be gone and I will lose money. I might get a small 5% downpayment for a really cheap condo, but my expenses would increase drastically.

I'm single and make $57,500 a year, have $7,000 in debt, and no car. I have contacted a lawyer to make a counter offer, but I don't know how much would be good or even if it's realistic to ask for more. If I'm able to get more money, I was thinking of maybe leaving my apartment, moving back in with my parents for 6 months-1 year and saving money for a 20% downpayment. Maybe buy something in Montreal or Quebec city or try for something smaller in Victoria. I can work remotely.

If anyone has any idea what price I should ask or...also I should maybe just stay in my apartment.

Edit: The place I live is a huge buiding. The company has several properties throughout British Columbia. There are a lot of people in my building that pay below market as they have lived there for 5-20 years.

1lg7aib,Renegotiate your rent,Flincher14,Housing,2013,0.96,182,"Rents are dropping around the GTA in most places and if you are paying too much. Consider negotiating at the end of your lease. 

A few months ago I posted that my rent was above market at a whopping $2850 a month and we even received a rent increase notice. When I spoke to the property manager they cancelled the rent increase and said it was a mistake.

I was not satisfied. They had listed other units in the building for $2500. So I asked for that rate and the building manager said no.

So I gave the building an N9 and the super of the building called me the same day to ask what they can do to keep my family from leaving. (We are good tenants).

I said I wanted the rate everyone else was paying $2500 and free parking. Which now they accepted when I was about to walk away.

But again. Before they served us a new lease at the new rate so I could sign and lock in. They lowered rates to $2300 on the same units. So I went back to negotiate again and they are hymming and hawing about it.

Anyways. Be prepared to walk away obviously. But also be aware of the area rental rates. We moved at peak rents last year to get up to $2850 in rent and only a year later it is now $2300. Rents all around me have dropped dramatically. We would be insane to accept paying a higher rate just for being loyal and so would you.

Update: they finally got back and said the $2300 rate is for new tenants only. They could offer us $2400. I said no that isn't logical.

Edit:

This seemed to have triggered the gold bugs:

> ""YoU aRe ChErRy PiCkInG dAtA! gOlD iS uP iF yOu BoUgHt In 2016"". 

1. You're now cherry picking. And I'm not talking about absolute returns here, I'm talking about inflation hedge. Was inflation between 2011 and 2022 0%? No. 

2. CPI as a measure of inflation averaged just below 2% between 2016 and 2020. So gold rallying when inflation was low only proves gold is not a good inflation hedge. Conversely, CPI was not negative between 2011 and 2016; if gold was a good inflation, gold shouldn't have sold off 50% during that period. 

3. March 2016 to March 2022, $GLD is up 55%, $URTH (MSCI World, as a proxy for asset inflation) is up 90%, M2 money supply increased more than 80%.

Here's why gold is a poor inflation hedge:

- academic studies have repeated proven that gold is volatile, a poor inflation hedge compared to Treasuries and equities, and could be a good *trading vehicle* during periods of high inflation


- The price action is not correlated to inflation nor ""money printing"". See #2 above.

- While CPI inflation has been non existent until 2021, asset inflation has been materially higher. Gold has been flat. New money supply has been flowing into stocks and other assets (real estate, vintage cars, art, whisky and wine) and not gold.",2022-03-30T10:41:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ts7yyf/if_you_invested_10k_in_gold_11_years_ago_you/,

127mf30,Meat Savings Find - Restaurant Supply Businesses,mostimprovedfrench98,Budget,1932,0.95,378,"I had my wifes birthday last week and she wanted me to bbq... for 20 people. Ribs are about 9 dollars  a rack at my regular grocery store, so for at least 10 racks so it would have been 100+ dollars.

I ended up calling a resteraunt supply butcher/grocer and they told me as long as I bought a minimum 20 pount order I could get it at 2.39 a pound.. Thats almost half the price.  


They also had ALL meats so if I ever wanted to get Lamb, Beef or anything else they can do that also in just a few hours.   


Since then I spent 150 dollars or so and have 30+ frozen steaks, ribs and chickens and other goods in my freezer. I no longer have to buy meat at the grocery store. My grocery price has reduced by almost 40% and I believe the quality is better.   


If you have a larger family, a big event or just access to a lot of freezer space I recommend going that route. You also need to be in a metropolitan area I would assume however over the course of the year it will save me thousands.

rbqsy2,It's time to take your cyber security seriously,_souldier,Misc,1931,0.97,277,"After seeing numerous horror stories of fraud and identity theft here on PFC, among my friends and family, and being a victim myself, I thought I'd make this post for others to benefit from. I may be preaching to the choir here at PFC but chances are someone out there needs to hear this. Putting a little time and effort to protect yourself can save you from waking up to your own horror story and compromising your personal finances.

This list is by no means exhaustive or perfect and I encourage others to comment below with their own tips.

\*I am not affiliated/sponsored with any service that I mention below.

**PASSWORDS**

* Use a substantially different password for **EVERY** online account. If one account is leaked in a data breach, your other accounts will still be safe.
* A place where you can see if your e-mail/password has ever been leaked in a known data breach is: [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/)
* Use **strong** passwords. My passwords are 21 characters with a mix of upper/lower case, numbers and symbols that are randomly generated. I don't memorize passwords. I wouldn't be able to tell you my passwords even if you put a gun to my head.
   * Example of a generated password: 2$J52\*9UZS@9s&@a&c6D#
* Your e-mail password especially should have a unique and strong password since it is a gateway to having access to all of your other accounts.
* Enable 2FA for critical accounts where possible
* Put a port block/transfer block on your cell phone number through your carrier. This prevents scammers from porting your number out to a new carrier, giving them access to your phone number and bypassing 2FA. A hacker has attempted to port out my number in the past.
* Use a proper password manager. You probably have over a hundred online accounts without realizing it. A password manager can auto-fill your username and password on your computer/phone so you don't have to. Not only does this make your life easier but it prevents keyloggers from intercepting credentials when you type out your password. Password managers also randomly generate strong passwords for you so you never have to think of one.
* The pw manager I personally use is Bitwarden. I like Bitwarden because it has rock solid security and the free version has most features that people need. The premium version is among the cheapest out there at only $10 USD a year. It also integrates well into my PC, browser and phone. Comment below with the password manager you prefer if you are already using one.
* Secret questions/answers that are completely random like passwords are more secure. Save this also to your password manager. If you bank with Tangerine, you should do this for your secret questions since they only allow you to have a 6 digit pin number to secure your account.

**PHISHING**

* One of the most common ways accounts are compromised is through a phishing attack where a person enters their username/password on a fake website that looks real or gives out sensitive information to the wrong person.
* These usually come through links in your e-mail, text messages, etc. that take you to counterfeited websites.
* Look at the website address to see if it is legit.
* Be aware of catphishing and your own emotional vulnerabilities.
* Don't fall for scam phone calls posing as CRA, Canada Border Services, delivery services, etc. Their caller ID is spoofed as a local number but they are probably calling from another country.
* You probably don't have a distant relative that suddenly wants to give you a large sum of money.
* When in doubt, don't enter your credentials or give it out to anyone.

**VIRUSES, MALWARE, SPYWARE, ETC.**

* Practice clean computer/internet use. Avoid going to questionable websites, clicking questionable links, making accounts on unsecure websites, installing questionable software, etc.
* Pornography, crypto, illegal streaming sites and many other are notorious for security breaches and installing spyware on your device.
* Keyloggers is a type of spyware that logs your every keyboard stroke and sends it to hackers, making it easy for them to obtain your passwords and any other sensitive information.
* Only download software from the official website of a trusted company and beware of websites posing as legit.
* Avoid using USB drives and such on public computers then opening them on your own computer. I format my USB drive before opening it on my computer if I know I've used it somewhere else.
* If you haven't been using your devices in a safe way, I would personally just do a complete factory reset/clean install of the operating system or at least do a full virus scan.
* Keep antivirus up to date on your computer. For PC I just use the built-in Windows Security.

**BANKING**

* Enable live notifications for all banking transactions. The instant a penny goes in or out of my account or any other change is made, I get a notification on my phone app and e-mail. This has allowed me to instantly catch fraudulent credit card expenses and report it immediately.
* Set proper daily max spending limits through your bank.
* Use a credit card rather than debit card for most purchases when possible.
* Using services like google pay allows you to tap pay with your phone so you don't have to use the physical card that can easily be skimmed.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

* Monitor your credit report using both Credit Karma (Transunion) and Borrowell (Equifax) for free. This allows you to see when someone opens a new account, uses a new address, does a credit inquiry, etc. under your name which can help you to detect identity theft early rather than it go on for years (happened to a friend of mine). I get e-mails from them when any change takes place on my credit report. I personally find paid credit monitoring services as a waste of money.
* Use a secure web browser that does not spy on you. I use Vivaldi which has built in tracker/ad blocking and is one of the most feature rich browsers out there. Firefox would be my second choice.
* Avoid making too many details about your life public on social media.
* Your friends and families e-mail/social media accounts are often hacked, so avoid sharing sensitive information with them there. You can be blackmailed in the future for what you share privately.
* Avoid using public wi-fi. If you must, then use a VPN.
* Use a good password for your home wi-fi.
* Make sure your partner or spouse's accounts are protected as well.
* Pro tip: If you use Gmail, you can add + to the end of your e-mail so you can use a different e-mail for every place that you make an account. For example johndoe+reddit at gmail dot com is the same as johndoe at gmail dot com. This allows you to see if any websites share your e-mail with spammers and adds an extra layer of security. Try sending an e-mail to yourself using this method to see that it works. Read more about it here: [https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308648?hl=en](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9308648?hl=en)

Don't feel that you have to apply everything overnight. Focus on the most critical things first such as password management then secure other areas at your own pace.

Edit: This is blowing up more than I thought. I won't be able to reply to comments until after work if at all. Hopefully others here can help reply to people's questions. I'd also like to mention that I am no cyber security expert, just someone who has picked up these tips along the way to protect myself.

\----------------------

Final Edit: Thanks everyone for the feedback and awards. If this has helped someone out there to make some changes to their online security practices, then my mission in making this post has been fulfilled. I encourage everyone to do their own research to verify anything mentioned in this thread. I cannot reply to any more comments as the mods have decided to lock this thread.

A final thought is that I've looked into the use of strong ""passphrases"" based on some comments below and I am convinced that they can be more secure yet easier to type out and remember than the password example I gave above. I am inclined to use passphrases in the future when I change my passwords. Here is an example of one generated by my pw manager:

* Kinship-Overbid7-Gibberish-Wisdom-Regular
* Passphrases are harder to crack because of their sheer length and eliminate the need to use symbols, mixed cases and numbers when they are long enough. This example above is around 40 characters long.
* Strong passphrases should have 4 or more words.
* Here is a great document from the University of Berkley's security office on this topic: [https://security.berkeley.edu/MSSND/passphrase-guidelines-draft](https://security.berkeley.edu/MSSND/passphrase-guidelines-draft)",2021-12-08T07:58:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/rbqsy2/its_time_to_take_your_cyber_security_seriously/,
1gl8797,RBC is completely insane ,CustomerOk4066,Banking,1930,0.94,491,"So I recently had quite an interesting experience with RBC. My brother was visiting me from Europe s month ago , and one day, while we were out in downtown Toronto, we stopped by one of RBC’s flagship branches. We just wanted to do something simple: exchange his 2,000 Swiss francs for Canadian dollars.

Right away, things got weird. RBC asked for ID, even though they usually don’t for amounts under $3,000. My brother didn’t have his ID on him, so I offered mine. They then spent half an hour running around with his francs, inspecting them closely, and even the manager took a magnifying glass to examine them! After a lot of fuss, they finally agreed to the exchange, though they changed the amount in CAD three times. We went ahead with it. We got the dollars, a receipt, and left.

Two weeks later, I get a call from RBC saying, “Hey, remember those francs you exchanged? Turns out we shouldn’t have accepted them. Could you come by, return the dollars, and take your Swiss francs back?” To say I was stunned is an understatement. I refused, obviously, as my brother had already left and spent the money.

Another week passes, and I get another call—this time from the branch manager, the same one with the magnifying glass. He says, “Yeah, you need to come by and pick up those Swiss francs because they shouldn’t have gone through our system.” But here’s the kicker: since I used my ID, they found my RBC account and blocked the equivalent amount on it.

At that point, I was floored. All I could think to say was that I’d be taking this to court.

So, what’s the deal? Am I right in thinking this is a rare opportunity to challenge RBC and push back, or is there something about Canadian banking practices that I’m missing here? To me, this seems like a clear violation of Consumer Rights, Bank Conduct Operations , and possibly even Personal Rights.

Update: RBC removed the block from my account today and sent me the reconciliation letter. They sorry for inconvenience caused and promised to educate their staff.

1kh71eb,"We pay over $150K in realtor commissions. For what, exactly?",biggeorge76,Budget,1913,0.94,692,"I’m not anti-realtor, but I don’t really get why we’re still expected to pay over $150K in commissions over a lifetime. Real estate isn’t baking a cake, sure, but it’s not rocket science either. I could add a healthy margin to my retirement for what we pay

I always hear that “a good agent pays for themselves,” but I don't really buy it. Their incentive is to close quickly, not necessarily to maximize your sale price. Whether your home sells for $10K more or less barely changes their commission — maybe a $250 difference. And when you look at studies that aren’t coming from within the industry, FSBO homes tend to sell for roughly the same. There’s one from the NBER that looked at 15,000+ homes in the States and found no price difference when comparing similar listings.

I like seeing companies like [newerarealestate.ca](http://newerarealestate.ca) or zown trying to lower commission. It’s kind of wild that fees haven’t really budged, even though the whole process is online now

So why don’t more people just sell themselves? FSBO.ca and ListedBySeller.ca have been around for ages. They’ll get you on REALTOR.ca for a few hundred bucks, though they’re pretty limited in terms of tools. In the US, companies like Houzeo or Realstar.ai are giving sellers proper tools realtors would use. In Canada, the only one I’ve come across that looks similar is [Swimhomes.ca](http://swimhomes.ca) but they're only in ontario.

I feel like this is the easiest way to inject $150k into your retirement.

fj2skd,The benefits of the Canadian public healthcare system on our personal finances during a health crisis cannot be overstated,vicintoronto,Misc,1880,0.96,343,"Especially when you read articles such as [this one from Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-americans-cant-afford-coronavirus-treatment-costs-2020-3):

>Miami resident Osmel Martinez Azcue's coronavirus testing, including an ER visit and flu testing, cost $3,270. Azcue, who ultimately didn't have coronavirus, was sent a claim for $1,400 out-of-pocket after his co-pay was applied.  
>  
>It's all a huge problem for the 27 million Americans who don't have insurance — 28% had trouble paying medical bills in the past year, per a CDC report.

Insured Americans might face two challenges, according to Graves: surprise billing or being sent to an out-of-network facility if their in-network facility has reached capacity. Here, a bill could still exceed $10,000, he said.

Since this article was written, [it appears that the CDC will pay for testing, but not for treatment](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/katie-porter-cdc-coronavirus-testing-white-board/index.html).

sjngs4,Worst Financial Decision of My Life,Used-Willingness9661,,1873,0.9,1151,"Wife and I bought a house.

Paid 735,000 CAD for it with a 20% down.

Still have about 30K in retirement savings in WS ETF (XGRO).

Emergency fund - had 24K, gonna use 14K for property taxes coming up soon.

House is in terrible condition on the inside. Looks amazing from outside and all flaws have been covered.

My wife and I were stupid and didn't see the red flags. But what's done is done.

The problems are:

1. Basement is unfinished.
2. Previous owner had mold problems which are resolved but have reappared.
3. attic has no insulation so we're basically heating the attic at the moment. The soffits are blocked and the shingles above have become terrible despite only being a 10 year roof.
4. all doors don't latch
5. all rooms are cold despite being a 2021 hvac system (we're sleeping in the living room of a 4 bedroom house with winter jackets on)
6. 1 wall is wet (probably foundation water leakage)
7. probably a ton more repair work we haven't found yet.
8. EDIT - no vent in main bathroom, won't be surprised to find mold in walls.

Contractor quotes for fixing everything are well above 30-40K (basically wipe out our savings entirely).

we make 120K a year.

Cherry on top, ~~our realtor~~ we waived inspection and legal guarantees so we have no recourse against the previous owners.

We moved in a week ago and have already made like 4 trips to home depot spending > 100$ each time. Also bought a car at the same time because we moved from downtown to suburbia.

I know I've made several bad decisions. But my choices now are:

1. put the house back on the market and take the loss of maybe 30,40,50k (hopefully).
2. go all in and put all our savings into it to try and salvage it.
3. looking for other options ...

UPDATE FEB 4th: I've read every single comment and thank you so much for the good and bad comments. I sincerely appreciate everyone taking the time to reply. Even the ones that feel my wife and I deserve this. I also am extremely grateful for the excellent advice and personal DM's I've received offering to help or just support. The next step that I feel is the right one is:

1) Keep the house - selling it a week after buying is sus and also unethical and will guarantee the loss.

2) Get a mold inspection asap to confirm it is mold.

3) Already called government for an inspection that is required for the insulation rebate / money. They are a bit backed up so I don't know when they will arrive. Quebec has it's own website for this and they said it would take 5-7 days for an inspector to get in touch.

4) Get the attic insulation and roof replaced by professionals. Hopefully after the government inspection, so that I can claim the rebate in 3.

5) Attempt to add exhaust vent to upstairs bathroom while 4. is happening.

len1wx,Everyone moving to the East Coast for financial reasons. Here’s some quick facts from someone who moved to NB from AB.,,,1852,0.94,594,"1: French isn’t required, but it helps. So far I’ve had no issue finding work in Moncton but I did lose a fairly nice looking Government job because being Bilingual was technically part of the preferred requirements.

2: Housing is cheap but the bubble is real. My neighbour (from Toronto) bought a house in central Moncton for 120k in fall 2018 and sold it for 169k in summer 2020 after some fairly minor renovations. 

Bonus insight on this. My real estate agent says he thinks the prices will continue to rise in NB until they’re on pair with Halifax/Montreal/St Johns and other “small cities”. At which point demand will drop and house prices will dip. Right now the only thing more attractive about NB than NS is the housing market in major centres. 

3: There’s lots of jobs if you look hard enough. Nothing is posted on indeed. 

4: It’s arguably cheaper to buy than rent so if you’re selling to come down here it’s probably best to go “all in” and buy a cheap home than it is to rent for a year. 

5: It’s super sloooooooow here. Everything is laid back, no one is in a rush, no one is going to break their back to get a job done. It’s like everyone is semi retired. 

6: Because of that, if you’re the go getter type it’s easy to get ahead. The guy who owns the triplex across the street from me is only 28, he moved here 3 years ago and owns 6 buildings. He’s not afraid of hard work and Moncton will reward that. 

7: Move here for the right reasons. If you’re only moving here because it’s cheap that isn’t the right reason. 

8: The amount of things to do is directly related to what you currently do in your current city. The nightlife is pretty much non existent, doesn’t seem to be much in the way of concerts. There’s lots of good restaurants thought. And you’re not that far from Halifax and Montreal. 

9: Healthcare sucks. The hospitals suck. There’s not enough family doctors. It just sucks in general.

10: The French/English school system is awful. In some areas the French schools are much much better than the English schools but have strict requirements for enrolling. In areas where the English schools are better you’re in luck because that’s the default system kids are pushed into. Basically, you don’t want to move to a “French” area if you only speak English at home, however if you’re bilingual and can put your kids in French school moving to a French area could be very beneficial. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

Edit: I get it. Montreal shouldn’t be lumped into an group with Halifax or any other small city. We are not worthy.",2021-02-07T09:05:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/len1wx/everyone_moving_to_the_east_coast_for_financial/,

I worked hard to go from an internship after university at 22 that paid me $15 an hour to a job with the government at 25 that paid me $84,000 a year. I’m lucky because I live with my grandmother who doesn’t charge rent. That’s basically it, and I don’t spend recklessly. 

Thanks for reading! I’m off to celebrate with pizza and start thinking about what to do next in terms of saving for my own place.

kvwng8,"Why I left Questrade as a Platinum client, and why you should too.",cecilpl,,1831,0.96,463,"EDIT 1/19: Shortly after posting this, I received a message from Questrade's customer support, and was put in touch with Questrade's executive team. They promptly resolved all my outstanding issues to my satisfaction. 

tl;dr: Their customer service is now terrible. We're talking me having to initiate contact over a dozen times to process a simple transfer, them nearly costing me 5 figures of tax liability, and them transferring 6 figures of stock to the wrong account and then ignoring me forever.

I've been a Questrade client since 2009. I've advocated for them, and am a ""Platinum"" client (>$250k, entitles you to ""priority"" support). No more.

My ex-wife and I recently signed a separation agreement, and the terms included 1) Me rolling over some of my RRSP to her and 2) Us equally dividing a joint unregistered account between us. Simple, right? Apparently not for Questrade.

I first called the Platinum line October 7 and waited 20 minutes (standard wait time, as I'd learn). I was told to sign some transfer forms, email them in, and they'd process things. I suggest I need a T2220 (Spousal RRSP rollover form), I'm told no need. Cool, that sounds easy enough. I sent them in within the hour.

2 days later, no response, I followed up. 3 days later, no response, I followed up. 4 days later, no response, I called in again, and was told I had to ""upload"" the documents rather than emailing them. This pattern of me having to check in on them would prove to be the standard.

Then I was told I'd need to upload the separation agreement. I did so.

Cue no response, and me following up on Oct 10, Oct 12, Oct 13, all emails disappearing into the Questrade support black hole.

Oct 14 I call again and talk to a rep who gives me his personal extension, which I'd come to memorize over the following weeks! He says I need to upload the transfer forms again, so I do.

Oct 15 I'm summarily informed by email form letter than all my transfer requests have been cancelled because my ex's account is ""in the wrong status"". I call my guy, who tells me to tell my ex to call Questrade support. Fine.

For brevity I'll spare you some minutiae here of me initiating contact three more times, going back and forth over ""corrupted"" documents and misunderstandings about what I'm asking for.

Finally Oct 22 the transfers complete! Alas, I notice they have processed the RRSP rollover as a WITHDRAWAL AND DEREGISTRATION, which will attribute 6 figures of income to me and permanently lose me that much RRSP room. Shaken, I call my guy again and demand this be fixed immediately. 

Four days go by with no communication, so of course I follow up again and am told they do in fact need the T2220 form to process the RRSP rollover, like I suggested in my initial contact. Unfortunately they don't know how to fill out the form properly. I fill it out, send it in, wait 2 days, call in, am told I filled it out wrong and to do this part differently. Then I repeat that process for a third time.

Finally they fix it, and I immediately transfer all my assets to another broker. Phew! Unfortunately this story isn't over.

Two months later my ex calls me and asks what's taking so long for transfer #2 (splitting the joint account). I go through my statements in detail and notice that THEY TRANSFERRED BOTH HALVES OF THE JOINT ACCOUNT TO MY PERSONAL ACCOUNT, despite signed transfer forms to the contrary. Of course simply reversing this isn't possible since I've since moved the assets away from Questrade.

I'm now working with my new broker to create an account there for my ex so I can transfer her what she's owed. There are obviously tax implications here that I am working with a tax lawyer to solve.

I emailed Questrade Platinum support about this last fuckup on Dec 18 and Dec 30, warning them that I would detail this story publicly, but they have summarily ignored me both times, probably because I'm no longer a client and so they couldn't care less. 

Let me be very clear about that last part. They transferred 6 figures of stock to the wrong account, and then when informed of their error multiple times they ignored me for a month and counting.

I guess the moral of the story is you get what you pay for.",2021-01-12T12:51:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kvwng8/why_i_left_questrade_as_a_platinum_client_and_why/,

What’s even worse is they are questioning the number and breadth of X-rays and preemptive fillings, even the quality of recent cleanings that were recommended by my Canadian dentists. I’ve had a number of different dentists in Canada so this is definitely not an isolated incident.

x8j29g,BC government is placing a 2% cap on rent increases for 2023,RichRaincouverGirl,Housing,1821,0.85,948,"THIS IS A BIG RELIEF for most of us renters.

I've seen some threads about landlords already raising 8% starting in January 2023.

If you are in BC, this is ILLEGAL. Make sure you read about the tenant law. I'm sure many landlords will try to kick their old tenants and find new tenants with a higher upfront price.

&#x200B;

for the previous post, the landlords must give  you a rent increase notice within 2-3months (i forgot which one).

&#x200B;

If your landlord gave you a notice of raising 8% of the rent in January 2023, you can simply deny.

The best option is wait until January 2023 and tell them their previous notice is invalid because the rent increase capped at 2%. The landlord will have to issue you another 2-3 months notice which means for the first 2-3 months, you don't have to pay anything extra.

&#x200B;

Please don't think they are your family. They are being nice to you because it is the law and **you are PAYING FOR THEIR MORTGAGE.**

If you live in BC, tenants have more power than landlords.

You need to scroll down and click on ""Data Table"" to see the more specific breakdown of income percentiles for each age.

So, for instance if your age is 28 and your income is $60,000, that would place you slightly above the 80th percentile in terms of income for people the same age as you. You can also find the median income for each age just from the 50th percentile.

“A Bank of Canada report last year found that Canadians racked up $3.4 billion worth of rewards from their credit cards in 2018, with higher-income earners benefiting the most because they are far more likely to use credit cards as payment.

Those rewards come at a steep cost for merchants — more than $11 billion in 2018, the central bank found — but many consumers will be unlikely to give up those perks.” 

To me as a one consumer I can’t justify that negative return as the cost of everything has already skyrocketed. Just my thoughts, interested in what others have to say/how they feel on the matter.

mlefwm,My journey to $1M RRSP started 25 years ago,spooge_mcnubbins,Retirement,1798,0.96,374,"I see lots of people on here just starting out with their retirement savings. I thought it might be interesting to see a real-life example of one person's retirement savings journey. I don't consider myself typical, because I do make quite a bit compared to the Canadian average, but I want to show what can happen with slow and steady investing over a long time period. I'm not retired yet, but my RRSP recently broke through $1 million dollars (yaay!) after 25 years of RRSP investing and I wanted to share this. I'm not a stockbroker and don't pretend to have some magical insights into the market other than buy low-cost broad-market ETFs. I've been through 6 corrections/crashes from the dot-com bubble through COVID. I fully acknowledge that I'm in a very advantageous position due to a well-paying IT job and being able to get into the housing market long before the huge run-up in prices (my first home cost me $135,000) so my experience won't likely translate to today's reality.

For a bit of context for those who asked, I'm nearly 50 years old (will turn on 420!) with a wife and child. I own a house just outside the GTA in Ontario. Lived in Ontario all my life.

When I did my taxes (on paper!) in the spring of 1996, I was left with a staggering tax bill of something like $700. As a young 20-something dude taking home $1800 a month with car payments/rent/food/entertainment eating up most of that, I certainly didn't have $700 lying around. Somehow, I learned about some too-good-to-be-true saving strategy that would reduce my tax bill to zero. All I had to do was take out a loan to myself for $1095 and deposit that amount into this fancy account called an RRSP. All I had to do was pay off the loan over the next year. Making 12 monthly payments of $87.53 (to myself!!!) at 7% interest was much more palatable than coming up with $700 to give to the tax man. SIGN. ME. UP.  I opened up a self-directed RRSP account with my bank at CIBC. This inadvertently started my retirement savings journey that has recently seen it hit the magical $1 million mark after just a hair over 25 years.

I've learned a lot over the years. After I paid off my initial RRSP loan, I realized that it would be better to make automatic regular contributions instead of taking out a loan every year, at which point some of my hard-earned money would go to the bank in the form of interest. I started with $125 a month put into what I now know are high-cost mutual funds. I thought taking that money out of my limited budget would hurt, but I really didn't notice it after the first few months. I adjusted my spending patterns without any real difficulty.

The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 1999 didn't hit my portfolio hard, but my RRSP didn't grow for an entire year, even with regular contributions which had grown to $600/month thanks to a new high-paying IT consulting gig that grossed me $100K+/year for a few really good years. After that gig ended, I took a salaried IT consulting job for $65K/year. That company had an RRSP-matching program, which I took full advantage of. My RRSP value grew slowly, but steadily. For a while, I would jump from one under-performing mutual fund to the latest ""hot"" high-fee mutual fund only to repeat the same pattern every year or so. My returns were never stellar as a result of the drag incurred by the high MERs, even as I transitioned from boutique mutual funds to index mutual funds.

In 2008, I learned about low-cost ETFs and the Couch Potato investing strategy. I opened an account with QTrad and switched all my mutual funds from CIBC Investors Edge to Vanguard/iShares just in time for the 2008 crash. Luckily, I paid off the mortgage on my first home not long after the crash, and I plowed the majority of my old mortgage payment into my RRSP until we moved into a bigger home in 2012 just after our child was born. My RRSP contributions dropped dramatically due to my wife taking an extended maternity leave, but my RRSP grew steadily.  After my wife went back to work in 2014, I increased my contributions again and kept increasing along with my salary, which topped out at $135K/year in early 2015.

In 2015, I took a new job paying a fair bit more than my old job and started whittling away at my expanding RRSP contribution room. Along with regular contributions, I would throw as much as possible from my emergency fund into my RRSP every spring to maximize my tax return which I would use to replenish my emergency fund. This year, I finally used up all my available RRSP contribution room. Thanks to the increasingly nutty stock market, my RRSP recently broke through the $1M barrier.

My current RRSP breakdown looks like this:

# CDN RRSP

|XGRO|26.4%|
|:-|:-|
|VCE|10.8%|
|Cash|2.7%|

# USD RRSP

|VEA|20.4%|
|:-|:-|
|VWO|3.5%|
|VTI|35.8%|
|Cash|0.3%|

Thanks to a helpful Redditor that I can no longer find, I looked up my total RRSP contributions from 1996 to today, and it totals $384,530.  The rest are capital gains and dividends.

It feels like the current stock market run-up is unsustainable, so I've got some cash sitting in a money market fund waiting for a correction. This is outside my normal monthly contributions, which goes straight to XGRO via PAC. My investing strategy is buy broad market ETFs and HOLD. I don't pretend to know what's coming next, which I guess I contradict by holding some cash for a presumably eventual correction. I just hate missing out on buying opportunities. On the other hand, I've been proven wrong more often than right, so maybe I should just put it to work in XGRO.

I'm still 10-15 years away from retirement, so I don't feel I need to start adjusting my strategy yet. Moving forward, I plan on maxing out my RRSP every year and adding as much as I can to my TFSA (which has been pretty much ignored in favour of RRSP), while paying down the mortgage over the next 10 years. With a bit of luck, I should have a very comfortable retirement that allows my wife and I to travel and have lots of fun until we can't do it anymore.

Even though past performance isn't an indicator of future performance, I hope that this peek into some rando's retirement strategy over 25 years gives people some hope for a nice chunk of retirement money at some distant point.  Believe me, even though 25 years seems like a long time, it really isn't. Keep plugging away.

I signed a 4 month lease for a suite, and near the end, I told her I had to find roommates because I wouldn’t be able to afford the rent anymore, even though I would have loved to stay.

She sounded disappointed, and offered to cut my rent 50% to stay. She said I was the best tenant I ever had. This rent reduction would continue on a month-month basis until I’m working full-time in the summer again, so about 5 months.

Honestly she helped me a ton. As a 19 year old student, I was cutting through my savings that I’d worked for, and I really appreciated my own quiet space to study. 

We’re going back to the regular rent in the summer, then I will be leaving in September. What could I do to show that I’m grateful? I was thinking of letting her keep the damage deposit. The suite came furnished, there’s no carpet, and I’m a clean guy. I can’t imagine I would be using any of it up. I’ve lived in a few suites now and my damage deposit always came back to me 100%. 

I’m *definitely* not rolling in money, and having that damage deposit (or any extra money) would help a lot. But if you rub my back, I’m the kind of person to rub yours too.

gm6cm4,I manage a software development division at a medium-sized Canadian company - this is why I think work from home will NOT become the new normal,LiveTheDreamEveryDay,,1757,0.94,389,"Hi,

For the past 15 years, I have been working in tech in Toronto, and have moved companies 3 times in that time period. Starting in 2016, I was brought on to manage a software development division at a mid-sized Canadian company. My department currently has 216 employees, ranging from software developers to devops to database administrators. If you live in or have visited Canada, I can more or less guarantee that you have used or worked with a product my team has built.

Shortly after I joined my current company, I fought for, and won, the ability for any of my staff to work from home indefinitely. I had worked remotely for 2 years at my previous job and very much enjoyed it, and I felt that it was something that technology-minded folks appreciate. Anyone choosing to take this option was given a work laptop, VPN access and any support they needed getting set up at home - we also gave a stipend to cover increased electricity, internet and phone usage. Additionally, work start and end times were made flexible, as long as you were broadly available between the hours of 10am and 4pm (our core business hours).

Approximately 55% of my staff chose to start working from home in the first few months, with most (89%) of them trying it for atleast a few weeks before the end of 2018. We commissioned a study at the end of 2019 to gather feedback on the work from home program, and we got a lot of surprising results. Based on that survey, and some things I observed over the past 4 years, here's why I think work from home will **not** be the new normal, even after covid19 is no longer a threat.  


* The delineation between what is 'work' time and what is 'family' time blurs with work from home, and gets worse over time. While we know that people will often respond to an email at 8pm whenever they have downtime, we noticed a significant increase in 'work' activities after hours, well in excess of the normal hours worked we expected of the staff.    
Of the people working from home in the first year of the program, more than 60% worked more than an extra 5 hours a week in these impromptu after-hours sessions with other coworkers. It got to the point that VPN login prompts needed to be sent to managers after hours for approval for some divisions.  
The survey indicated that most (85%) of employees working from home found it difficult to allocate their time between work and non-work activities, with that percentage growing the longer the person worked from home. Essentially, it became difficult for people to separate work from personal life, and numerous employees reported feeling obligated to work extra hours because their coworkers were doing so, while also simultaneously looking down on employees who DID NOT work those extra hours.  
The worst consequence of extended work from home reported was difficulty in marriages and partnerships due to the feeling of not being able to separate from work when at home.  

* Office perks were also flagged as something that was missed with work from home. Our office provides coffee, snacks, full breakfast every day and catered lunch every Friday (or Thursday if Friday was a holiday). The office perks were upgraded significantly in 2017, and many of the workers who started working from home in 2016 felt dissatisfaction at that (previously, we just offered coffee and snacks; breakfast and catered lunch were added later), with many choosing to return to the office after the perks were upgraded.  

* For approximately 40% of the employees working from home, work quality was lower, ranging from minor issues (missed deadlines by a day or two) to significant (basic rudimentary design mistakes). Around 20% of employees working from home saw significant improvements in work quality, while the remaining 40% were roughly the same in the office as working from home.   
We attribute this to some people naturally being better 'wired' for working from home.   
Interestingly, the vast majority (94%) of people who improved in work quality were software developers, with most other positions performing equally or worse to their in-office performance (notable exception: project management was in the dumps for work from home, we theorized that role naturally attracts people that are better suited for face to face interaction).  

* Most workers (75%) reported their social lives suffered due to work from home. This was attributed to a range of issues, from the feeling of 'needing' to be available 24/7 to lack of face to face interaction in daily life outside of direct family members. We noticed over time that those who thrived in the work from home environment did not report those same issues (they had a robust social life outside of work), but the majority of people relied on in-person social interaction in the office.

Now, keep in mind that all of this feedback was obtained before covid19 forced my entire department to work from home. While the majority of employees in my department tried working from home for atleast 3 months, as of January 2020, only 36% were still working from home; the rest had returned to the office of their own volition.

Since people were forced home, and many were forced home with their partners and children (which was not a regular occurrence pre-covid), most are now ranking working from home as very poor, with more than 78% of employees indicating they want to come back in to the office when it is safe to do so (which includes significant overlap with the people that previously **requested** to work from home indefinitely, and indicated that they were happy with the arrangement).

This is a really long way of saying, I don't see this pandemic leading to any significant changes in work behaviours in the long term - I'm not seeing a 'work from home' revolution decimating real estate in major Canadian cities in the cards.

Edit: Since a number of people have asked, the positions that did the best working from home could be summarized as those that had very few creative requirements - eg, software devs working from a clearly defined and described requirements list who didn't have to interact with internal stakeholders. More creative and soft-skilled positions tended to do worse, such as a business analyst gathering requirements. I am NOT drawing any conclusions based off these metrics, there are way too many variables to point to any specific data point as the root cause!",2020-05-18T13:50:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/gm6cm4/i_manage_a_software_development_division_at_a/,

k06lgt,Unpopular Opinion - Buying a house isn't the ultimate goal to financial wellbeing. It's one of many paths.,Evilbred,,1733,0.91,555,"Myself and my family, \~160k income sold our house in 2013 and became renters.

Friends and family told us we were wasting our money ""paying someone else's mortgage"" and going backwards in life. 

Fast forward to today, we hit the $1 million mark on investments and pension plans, zero debt. My friends and family still think we are wasting our money paying rent, meanwhile our investments generate many times our rental costs. 

We personally prefer the rental life. We live in a downtown apartment, it's small but very nice. We walk everywhere, takes <10 minutes to get to work and live a fairly stress free life. 

For us, choosing to rent instead of own was the best financial decision we ever made. 

Why am I writing this? Because I am seeing alot of my friends and coworkers so focused on homebuying as their goal, I wonder if they ever really stepped back and asked if it does make the best sense financially and for their lifestyle. 

I feel homeownership is overvalued in Canada, to the point where people's retirement plan largely consists of their equity. And for me, investing nearly your entire life savings into one specific asset class is fraught with risk. I do get that for many people, home ownership is forced savings and possibly the only way they'd have a positive networth down the road.

They just sent out [this email](https://i.imgur.com/1XYQZ86.png) this morning advertising same-day loans of up to $45k, dressed up as a ""we're helping"" ad.

Do not fall for this. These are loans from EasyFinancial, which is a notorious instalment lender that is basically just a payday loan outfit in all but name. Here's a [CBC Marketplace](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B39eDlBAUF8) bit on them from a few years back. Their interest rates are incredibly high (40%+ APR), and they also have a great somehow-legal scam they pull where they sell ""loan insurance"" that's basically worthless but the premium effectively doubles the monthly payment.

I think it's utterly disgusting and predatory that EasyFinancial and [LowestRates.ca](https://LowestRates.ca) are trying to profit off peoples' collective fears during the COVID-19 pandemic, but here we are. Fully in character for these parasites.

If you are in financial trouble due to COVID-19, other reasons, or a combination of both, there are other more productive things you can do:

* Apply for all the federal and provincial COVID-19 relief programs that you qualify for.
* If you are a renter, speak to your landlord about the possibility of a rent deferral. If they say no, pay what you can so that you still have enough left over to eat and stay put. Most provinces have suspended evictions for the duration of this crisis. Make a good-faith effort to pay what you can, but also understand that the government does not want a landlord making you homeless right now: don't let a landlord bully you into leaving while evictions are suspended. You can deal with settling up the tab when this is all over.
* If you own your home, talk to your mortgage lender about a deferral. All the big banks and many credit unions have payment deferral programs now for supporting people through this crisis.
* If you are being hounded by creditors for outstanding debt, there is not much they can do right now. Unless they have an active garnishment, the courts are closed for all but essential matters so it's not like they're going to go out and get a judgement now. Just hang up on the debt collectors. If you are insolvent, you can also consider talking to a Licensed Insolvency Trustee about filing a consumer proposal or declaring bankruptcy, which will stop all collection activity (including wage garnishment) and move you towards clearing out your debts.",2020-03-31T11:11:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/fselds/psa_lowestratesca_is_sending_out_emails/,

But I have also noticed in myself being far more concerned about money and making the right decisions and getting ahead and this comes with more anxiety and less general well being.

In my 20s I lived with several roommates in east Vancouver, worked to pay my bills and never more. Looking back it was undoubtably one of the best periods of my life. I was care free and I dont know if a value can be put on this. The amount of  fun I had seems impossible to me now, it gave me time to learn about myself, develop wonderful friendships and a long term relationship. I lived in what many wealthy people would probably consider terrible conditions but it honestly never bothered me for I was having such a good time. Let me stress good time does not mean partying, it means exploring life in ways not guided by the stress of always trying to be perfect or maximize potential.

When I'm 60 I doubt I'll look back and wish I had started my career earlier so I could have nicer stuff and a bigger house. The experiences were invaluable and I wouldn't trade them for the world. The goal of all of this is well being and happiness right? This post is sort  of a reminder to myself that one happiest periods of my life was also the poorest. 

So while I save and budget and all that, and dont intend to live the rest of my life in poverty,  I try to remind myself that you only get one shot at this life, and if you spend all your time preparing to live instead of doing so, it might just pass you by. In the end, relationships and experiences are a far more valuable currency.

I have a story of a neighbour of mine.   She left a big city for a smaller area about an hour outside Toronto.    She bought with 5% down, she waived inspection, and she bought a 100 year old house with zero renovation budget.  


Now, she's trapped in a house that needs a ton of work, in a city and neighbourhood she hates, and her mental health is declining rapidly.   And, she literally can't afford to sell.     


She has no equity.  Selling the house would cost so much that with 5% down (which basically covered CMHC insurance) means she is stuck in a house she can't afford to renovate, so she can't sell it for even enough to cover the costs of legal fees, early repayment penalties, any taxes, and real estate agents.

llfv79,Something is rotten in the GTA (and Canadian) real estate market and it isn't going to change,SentinelSpirit,,1628,0.94,1095,"...obviously.

My family spent the last 6 months trying to buy a detached home in Durham. I'll spare you the nightmarish details of 30 offer houses, near tear downs going for 170k over asking, prices going up 50k week over week, etc. but needless to say we've decided to call it quits for now. It was just that awful.

In the entire ordeal, one thing stood out more than anything else: a large proportion of buyers currently are investors, not people looking for a primary residence. Shockingly, we don't even actually have stats on the number of investors in the market as Stats Can (as far as I know) [doesn't gather this information.](https://chra-achru.ca/examining-the-dynamics-of-canadas-housing-tenure-system-implications-for-a-national-housing-strategy/)

The presence of investors in and of itself is not horrible, of course - someone has to provide rental properties. But when there is so much capital in the market (looking at you all time low interest rates) and so little inventory, the end result is that many people who are simply looking for a place to live are getting squeezed out.

A commenter on here recently suggested a great lever that the government could use to tamp down on this trend: **up the capital gains tax on non-primary residence sales.**

Thinking this was a great idea, I decided to do a bit more digging, and remembered something I had read a while back (originally posted by [fractx](https://www.reddit.com/user/fractx)) that took away all my enthusiasm:

The Canadian housing market is too big to fail.

1. **Real estate (and associated the construction sectors) are now the #1 contributor to GDP** at 15% of Canada's GDP. Over time the economy has morphed to depend on housing as our primary driver of growth. This has been even further exacerbated by COVID and the collapse in the Alberta oil sector. The Canadian economy is dangerously under-diversified with slow decade over decade declines in manufacturing, mining, etc. This is the primary reason why no politician would dare hurt the real estate or associated construction sectors currently - we have barely anything else propping up our country.
2. **A housing collapse would destroy the banking system,** which is built on collateral assets such as housing. [In Canada's largest bank's October 2020 credit risk analysis (see pg. 68), residential mortgages and HELOCs made up by far the most significant portion of all outstanding credit](https://www.rbc.com/investor-relations/_assets-custom/pdf/ar_2020_e.pdf). If home prices crater and homeowners are underwater, all Canadian banks would end up with negative equity (liabilities > assets) and everyone would stop lending to each other. Bankruptcies and unemployment would soar. It's ugly. The government would then have to spend massively more to bail out banks in addition to reviving a collapsed economy. That's what happened in 2008 before they started flooding the market with money to prop up banks in the US.
3. **Canadians own housing** and they don't want to see price come down. The majority of Canadian households in desirable cities are homeowners, and have their nest eggs invested in housing. Falling home prices sets everyone back from retirement, and they carry that displeasure to the polls during elections.
4. **Homeowners feel wealthier** when home prices go up, they go spend money in retail, food services, personal services, technology, etc. Those sectors then hire more people, and they increase their spending and the cycle continues. If the music stops, renters are often the first to lose their jobs.
5. **Local policies kowtowing to voters** have resorted to perverted NIMBY policies to slow the supply of new homes. Majority of City of Vancouver's land mass is zoned low density to maintain neighborhood characteristics. Voters go up in arms to protest whenever this zoning status is threatened. Vancouver city councillors voted in May to reduce building permits to supply new homes in Vancouver by half [source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-not-even-the-pandemic-slowed-vancouver-real-estate/).

This is why short of serious incompetence and negligence, no political will is ever strong enough to shake Canadian housing market. Real estate is not a strictly free market because of the emotional, social, economic, and political upheaval its unravel could cause. **This is also why every recession will see wealth inequality widen.**

The first thing the Canadian government did during COVID-19 was to save the housing market. Low interest rates, reduced stress testing thresholds, deferrals, giving homeowners money to pay mortgages, etc.

It's never going to stop until the threat to housing is removed.",2021-02-16T17:51:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/llfv79/something_is_rotten_in_the_gta_and_canadian_real/,
15fmxn4,Relatives say I'm too poor to inherit my dad's properties and they want to buy them instead. Need some advice.,NavXIII,Estate,1615,0.91,617,"EDIT: I would like to respond to some of the recent comments but after going to sleep and waking up, it seems that the mods locked this post for an unknown reason.

Hola,

Recently I attended my uncle's funeral and afterwards one of my cousins (not my uncle's son) and his wife came to me to discuss my future inheritance. At first, they asked me when I'm getting married (typical Indian behaviour), future plans, how much I make, etc. They then said I won't be able to pay the inheritance tax (~80k they said) if I wanted to inherit my dad's 2 houses in the GVA. I said I can sell one of the houses if I need to but they rebutted by saying that I cannot sell the property if it's not under my name and it won't be if I don't pay the inheritance tax. 

They want me to A) get married and have the wife pay for half the bills (to which I said no) or B) they want to buy the house from my dad and have me pay rent to them (why pay them rent when I can move elsewhere for cheaper).

I did not want to hear any more of their complaints so I left and went home.

For context (I don't have exact hard numbers with me at the moment):

My dad has 2 properties in the GVA under his name. The first was purchased in 2000 for around $250k. It was our primary residence for 22 years. I believe it is worth around $2mil on the market today.

Our second home was purchased in 2016 for $600k. It was a rental property for 5 years until we built a new home last year and moved in. The mortgage on this property is $1.2mil at the moment with ~$6000 in monthly payments at current interest rates.

The old house, and one of 2 legal basement suites in the new house are rented out for under market value to family friends for a total of $5000.

I have done some light researching and this is what I found regarding this topic:

1. There is no inheritance or gift tax in BC or Canada.

2. Any debts or taxes owing is paid for by the estate, not the inheritor, and shouldn't effect eligibility of inheritance.

3. There is no capital gains tax when inheriting the primary residence of the person passing it down.

4. There is no capital gains tax when selling my primary residence, even if that property is inherited.

5. There is capital gains tax when inheriting a property that is not the primary residence of the person passing it down (aka investment property). That would be 50% of the difference between the market value at the time of inheritance and purchase price, which would be counted as personal income.

6. There is a capital gains tax when selling an investment property that is inherited. 50% of the difference between the value at the time of inheritance and the sale price is counted as personal income.

7. As far as I understand, there is capital gains tax owing on any period in which a current primary residence was not a primary residence, and the opposite is true for a current investment property.

I would like some clarity regarding the points above.

I do not seem to understand their logic. They seem to be ill-informed or are intentionally scheming something. 

With regard to how I would manage these properties, I don't think I'll have issues paying off the month to month costs, and I have multiple contingency plans:

1. I graduated as an engineer recently and I currently make 50k a year working 3.5 days a week (this is not my engineer job, it's just a temporary job for now). If I need more money, I can just work more hours, get a new job, get second job, or start a side gig.

2. I don't like the idea of being a landlord with many tenants, but if I want to, I could get new tenants for higher rent, and rent out the remaining basement suite and all of our empty rooms. That would bring in $9k-$12k monthly.

3. I can sell one or both houses if I don't want to deal with the managing these properties, and I invest the money.

4. If I'm in a scenerio where I have no inheritance, I'm not going to stick around pay rent. I'll just move to Calgary, Halifax or the US for example.",2023-08-01T15:55:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/15fmxn4/relatives_say_im_too_poor_to_inherit_my_dads/,

While it's true that I overrated luck and underplayed my own talents, I still want to emphasize that there is still luck involved in my achievements. I was lucky that I never had bad luck. I was never grievously hurt, never in crippling debt, had great parents etc.

**Also for everyone that says I had really great networking skills, I reread my post and realized I made a huge omission. I was able to get job 2 because job 1 needed me to quit. That was how I was able to get into job 2. Granted I had to still pass the interview but there was still an element of luck involved here.**

&#x200B;

I was congratulating myself and feeling proud at how I was a ""self made"" man because I did this without help from my parents (tuition, moved out at 18, didn't give me a car etc). However looking deeper it was further from the truth. My parents moved to Canada when I was young and it gave me a greater opportunities. And although my parents didn't give me tuition money, a car or paid for my cost of living knowing that I could always fall back and stay at home if I needed was a huge mental and morale safety net. It also propelled me to take greater risks like a 30k/yr salary while renting in Toronto.

&#x200B;

I managed to get my first job by underbidding on the salary for 30k/yr. They were so shocked that they offered 35k instead. Then a string of luck got me to 6 figures.

&#x200B;

**Job 1 (2015):** 35k/yr. My first job was in advertising and it was mostly data entry stuff.

**Job 1.5 (2015):** 45k/yr. A few months in my company got bought up, parent company offered +10k/yr for everyone to stay on. 1 month later my office was closed down and got a huge severance, auto pay out on annual bonuses.

**Job 2 (2016-2020)**: 50k/yr - 60k/yr My manager in job 1 hooked me up with people in Job 2 **(EDIT) because company of Job 1 wanted me to quit rather than to stay on and relocate to Quebec**. Stayed on for a few years until this company was sold off in pieces. Start off with the same data entry stuff, but picked up a couple of projects along the way.

**Job 3 (2020-2021):** 75k/yr. Still in the advertising industry and the work is similar to things from Job 1, but at a different company.

**Job 4 (2021):** 97k/yr. Not quite 6 figures, but they offer 4% matching (also for the clickbait). Again this was just luck that a client from Job 2 needed someone to take over as they were bringing things in house and needed someone with experience.  I was able to negotiate heavily as I had the safety of my current job to fall back on if it didn't work, and I had no competition since I had laser focused expertise and experience that they didn't even post the job externally

&#x200B;

I do have advice regarding negotiating but no advice on how to be lucky.

&#x200B;

**Negotiating for your first job**: Do whatever it takes to get in. Your first job won't be your final job, use it to get in and use it add bullet points to your resume. Don't hold out for your first job to be your dream job or at a higher salary that you ""deserve"".

**Negotiate while you have a job:** While you have a job you are in the best position to negotiate. You can make riskier asks and you have greater leverage when your resume has ""Current"" as an end date for your latest job. While at job 2 I did sit in on some interview panels, and often someone who has no current job will get offered a lower salary vs someone who has a current job.

**Job hop for great salary adjustments:** Pretty simple math here. Job hopping gives you a greater pay bump than incremental raises. For example, if I were at job 1 at 35k/yr, I would need a $10,333 raise each year to catch up to my current pay.",2021-08-06T13:59:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/ozbyol/i_just_got_my_first_6_figure_job_at_30_and/,
lqds25,"Why doesn't the CRA provide a government-supported, free tax filing software?",TheFrightBringer,Taxes,1603,0.97,332,"I've been using StudioTax ever since I've been doing my own taxes, but I always found it weird that you need to hire an accountant or use a third-party software to file your tax. You would think that with taxes being something so government-involved and regular, that a free government-based filing software would benefit most people with simple taxes (single, one job, etc) and allow the government more control over taxes. Bonus points for integrating it with the online website. We can still have other software and accountants (for more complicated situations or UI preferences) and ALSO have a government-based one, and I can't see a reason why something hasn't already been developed.

Is it a technical or budget limitation or am I not considering something?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Just putting a comment I made up here for clarification. This is why I think it would be better to have a direct CRA software:

Current system:

* Go to the CRA website
* Look through the list of CRA-Approved software
* Review the different software and companies to determine whether they're credible and if you like their software UI
* Make sure there are no limitations that would affect you or payments in the software
* (Usually) make an account or register with the third-party software
* Link third-party software to your CRA account
* Finally use the third-party software to file the taxes

&#x200B;

Theoretical Direct System:

* Go to the CRA website
* Click on something like ""file your taxes here"" from your account page
* File your taxes directly

&#x200B;

While one might think there's not that many steps in the current system. Looking back at when I was 16 and filing for the first time, having a direct government system to file taxes would have been so much easier than spending 4 hours clicking through different pages — honestly I was really close to just giving up and not bothering to file because there were so many different isolated systems to click through. I believe the easier you make the process, the more willing people are to file their taxes (removing obstacles) and that it's something we should aim for.

rtn2yr,New year tax savings reminders,taxbuff,Taxes,1546,0.99,161,"Happy new year!  Here are some basic things to keep in mind for early 2022:

&#x200B;

1. **TFSA Room**: The TFSA dollar limit for 2022 is $6,000.  You can contribute this amount to your TFSA as of today, along with any lifetime limit you have carried forward.  If you withdrew amounts from your TFSA last year, the amount withdrawn is also added back to your TFSA room as of today.  [See this link](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/tax-free-savings-account/contributions.html) for how your overall TFSA contribution room is calculated.
2. **RRSP Room**: Contributions to your RRSP in the first 60 days of the year must be reported on your 2021 tax return, and can either be deducted on your 2021 return (to the extent you have a 2021 deduction limit, i.e. ""contribution room"", as per your 2020 Notice of Assessment) or carried forward and deducted on your 2022 or other future tax return (but only to the extent you have a deduction limit for 2022) - you can choose, but in most cases it's better to take the deduction on your 2021 return, unless you know with certainty you'll be in a much higher tax bracket in the very near future.  Your RRSP deduction limit for 2022 is 18% of your 2021 [earned income](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040/rrsps-other-registered-plans-retirement.html#earned_income), adjusted for certain items (like a [pension adjustment](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/t4040/rrsps-other-registered-plans-retirement.html#P2722_98650)), to a maximum of $29,210.  Technically, if you have the funds available, you can contribute both your 2021 deduction limit as well as your 2022 deduction limit any time in the first 60 days of the 2022 (note: only the former would be deductible on your 2021 return and the latter would give you a deduction on your 2022 return).  If you aren't sure what you're doing, seek advice, since contributing in excess of your available deduction limit can result in a 1% monthly tax on the excess.
3. **RESP and CESG**: If you have young children and contribute to an RESP, you may be eligible for an additional $500 CESG per child for 2022 as of today (but there are various [limits to be aware of](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/registered-education-savings-plans-resps/canada-education-savings-programs-cesp/canada-education-savings-grant-cesg.html)).  Consider contributing earlier in the year to get your grant earlier and get more opportunity for tax-deferred growth.
4. **Tax Withholdings**: Are you eligible for certain new credits this year?  If so, consider completing a new [form TD1](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/td1-personal-tax-credits-returns/td1-forms-pay-received-on-january-1-later.html) and submitting it to your employer’s payroll department so that they can reduce your withholding at source.  If you’re eligible for any deductions from net income (example: contributions you’ll make to an RRSP outside of an employer plan), consider completing [form T1213](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t1213.html).  You submit this to CRA, who then provides you with a letter for your payroll department approving reduced withholdings for you.  These procedures give you more after-tax funds with each pay.  Be careful though; if you over-estimate what you’re entitled to, you’ll likely owe when you file your return next year.
5. **Income Splitting**: If your registered accounts are maxed out and you invest in a non-registered account, consider ways to split income with family early in the year to get the most benefit. Although planning in this area is somewhat limited due to the [attribution rules](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/it511r/archived-interspousal-certain-other-transfers-loans-property.html), some strategies include a [prescribed rate loan](https://www.bakertilly.ca/en/banff-alberta/publications/reduce-your-family-taxes-with-a-prescribed-rate-loan) to a spouse to split investment income, or investing the Canada Child Benefit in an account in your child’s name.  Or, if you’re older and have more considerable wealth, consider an advance on inheritances to your adult children (but seek tax, financial planning, and family law advice before doing so).  There is no tax on a gift in Canada, but beware that gifting assets results in a deemed disposition which means you realize any accrued capital gain.  If you are gifting US situs property or are a US citizen, green card holder, or resident, get US advice first.
6. **Interest Deductions**: If you have debt on personal use property (like your home) and also own assets that generate income, like a rental property, dividend-paying stocks, or business assets, consider whether you may benefit by restructuring your debt to make your interest tax-deductible.  CRA has a simple example of how this could work using your [home mortgage and public company stocks](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-3-property-investments-savings-plans/series-3-property-investments-savings-plan-folio-6-interest/income-tax-folio-s3-f6-c1-interest-deductibility.html#toc16).  You can also search the sub for tons of examples and posts about the Smith maneuver, which is really just an organized way of going about this.  For unincorporated business owners / contractors, consider the [cash damming technique](https://ca.rbcwealthmanagement.com/documents/29328/1605186/cash%2Bdmming%2Bstrategy.pdf) to pay off personal debts while generating tax-deductible interest.
7. **Estimate Your Tax Owing**: For many of us, 2021 was an abnormal year and either our incomes were higher or lower than usual, or we took on a different role (e.g. switched from being employed to being a contractor).  Estimate your income tax early by using an [online tax calculator](https://www.taxtips.ca/calculators.htm) to avoid any surprises and prepare for any amount you may owe on filing, as well as your 2022 required instalments, to reduce the potential exposure to interest.
8. **Record Keeping**: Start the new year off right by keeping a good set of records.  This is particularly important for items that aren’t tracked for you by CRA or an employer, such as medical expenses, home office expenses, or child care.  Keep everything in a folder and consider an electronic/cloud back up.  Note that CRA has [requirements for electronic records](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/ic05-1.html) so that they are acceptable to support your tax filings.
9. **Wills**: With a new year, now is a good time to consider how your personal situation has changed.  Did your wealth change substantially?  New source of income?  Marriage/Divorce?  New children?  Death in the family?  Consider revising your wills if necessary.  There may be tax saving opportunities upon death.

I have used the amazon subscriptions for as long as its been available. I have automated so much of my shopping as a result. 

The list of items I have on subscription has slowly dwindled to very few because the mark up on amazon is so extraordinarily high it would literally be foolish to pay the price. 

Many of the companies themselves offer subscription models through them directly which is fantastic. 

Many of the companies are only available on amazon which is the bad news in my case. 

I bought some facewash on amazon that I used to buy from sephora. It was 3x the price for a smaller bottle. I didnt even read the price when I clicked until I saw what I was charged later. I went to sephora the next day and sure enough its the same price its always been. Many cosmetic products or perishable items are 2-3x the price on amazon now.

niqtd7,"I just had the worst experience with CIBC, will never use them again",Pure_snow12,,1524,0.96,346,"I helped my dad apply for a CIBC credit card 4 weeks ago online. It got approved immediately and the next day he received an email that said the card will arrive within 10 business days. 

After 3 weeks and nothing in the mail, I called them and was told that the card is in transit. They said if it doesn't arrive in a week to call them again.

Well, it's been a week since then. Today I called them to see what's up. I spent an hour on the phone and had to talk to 4 separate agents (!!!). They kept shuffling me off to different teams, and each time I spoke with a new person I had to re-explain what the problem was and provide the same information over and over (name, phone number, address, etc.). 

Finally, the last person told me we need to go to the branch and present government ID in order to proceed with the application. 

So my dad and I popped over to the nearest branch. The teller had no idea what to do with the situation. She checked their files and saw that the branch didn't receive a credit card under my dad's name, and told us to call the credit card department. I explained multiple times that we did call the credit card department, and they told us we had to go to a branch and present ID in order to proceed with the app. But apparently, there was nothing she could do (??). I started getting pretty mad at that point, 'cause we just wasted about 2 hours of the day dealing with CIBC. So I told her we want to cancel the card, 'cause this is just getting ridiculous. Then she tells me that she doesn't have the authority to cancel the card and we need to call the credit card department.

So then we went home, I called the credit card department again, got shuffled AGAIN to two separate agents, and had to re-explain the situation and provide the same info AGAIN to each person I talk to. Omg, at this point I am so frustrated. 

The final person I talked to told me.... wait for it.... that I need to go to the branch (!!!!) in order to cancel because we need to show ID. OMG I'm lost for words at this point...

After 3 hours of dealing with this, we decided to put that off for another day. 

**Bonus frustration with CIBC:**

\- Last year I switched banks from CIBC to Tangerine. I had to go into the branch to cancel my account. Fast forward a year later, I received a new CIBC debit card in the mail. ???? Turned out that my account never actually got cancelled..... so the person that handled the original cancellation screwed up, so I had to go to the branch again to get that done.

Unbeknownst to me I'd already completed step 1 back in December 2020 by blending and extending my then 3.14% rate down to a 2.76% rate with Scotia. Had 3.5yrs remaining on the 3.14% at the time and cost to break was like $27k.

After reading that post and associated article I jumped on to an application with Tangerine (where I bank anyway) right away. Long story short I've just finished switching from my blended 5yr 2.76% to a 1.69%  5yr fixed with Tangerine. Plus HELOC went from 2.95% to 2.35%. Tangerine also kicked in an extra $1750 to cover lawyer fees and appraisal. Break fee amounted to $2800 plus $250 discharge fee.

That's a net saving to me of over $18000 over 5 yrs.

And as an aside, throughout both rate reductions we've kept our payment the same accelerated b/w amount that we were originally paying on the 3.14% term.

1h2ut3t,"You need to earn $132K in 2024 to have the same purchasing power as $100K in 2013, but you need $210K if indexed to home prices (depending on the city)",-SuperUserDO,Meta,1486,0.96,256,"According to the CPI, $131,454 in 2024 is equivalent to $100,000 in 2013. However, compared to an index of home prices, you need to earn $208,710 in Vancouver or $229,438 in Toronto to keep up with your local housing market. 

I think this is where people can perceive that they're paying more in income taxes to keep up with the same lifestyle as before. 

Today, the marginal rate for $131,454 is 26% at the federal level, 12.3% in BC, and 11.2% in Ontario; this was also the case in 2013 for $100,000. 

However, the marginal rate for incomes required to keep up with housing is 29% at the federal level, 16.8% in BC, and 13.2% in Ontario. That's an increase from a total of 38% to 46% in BC and 37% to 42% in Ontario. 

Therefore, to buy the same amount of ""house"" in Vancouver as one could with a $100,000 income in BC, I would have required double the income and have a marginal rate that's nearly 8% higher than in 2013. 

In addition, this isn't even factoring the much higher cost of financing in 2024 compared to 2013. The Prime Rate in 2013 was 3%. Today, it's at 5.95%. I would guess that if we factor in the higher interest rates, the equivalent income would push you into the top marginal rate rate at the federal level as well (and probably most provinces). 

If it weren't for housing, affordability wouldn't be that big of a deal. Earning an extra 30% seems doable over 10 years. Earning an extra 100% seems much harder and having to pay higher taxes also seems unfair.

rsdg29,More People bashing the CPP,jside86,,1464,0.91,791,"As per this [CBC article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/cpp-premiums-bump-january-1.6300439), the CPP rate for 2022 is going up. 

The new rate for 2022 is 5.7% of the first $64,900 of income (minus the first $3,500 of income).

People (comment section) seems pissed that this rate is going up when in fact CPP is one of the best funded pension plan in the world. To many Canadians compare CPP to Social security in the US, which is a totally different plan. 

The main reason we have CPP is because most Canadians do not save enough for retirement. There is many reason why people can't save, but there is also a behavioral aspect to retirement savings that many Canadians don't understand or willfully avoid (for many it is painful to save and not spend it all). 

I know that people on this sub are not the norm,  and most of us here could do without CPP and would prefer to manage our own investments. But in the end, even for people like us (savers), CPP is a great tool. There are many ways to use CPP at your advantage by delaying it and using personally saved/invested assets between 65 and 70 years old (save for Old Age Security).

Without CPP many Canadians would struggle when they reach retirement age and/or cannot work due to age, physical, mental or other reasons.

Also, when CPP was created, the average lifespan of the Canadian population was lower. Now some people will receive a pension for more than 30 years, which was not the original intent/design of the plan. 

With the ever increasing lifespan and the fact that most of the population is not investing for their future, we need to keep CPP alive. Most of all, we need to fund the plan appropriately to allow future generations to receive a similar benefit.   

Will the CPP increase affect you? How are you planning to integrate CPP with your investments?

Pay is almost $50/hr with a cost of living adjustment every April, shift is 7 days, 7 off, 7 nights, repeat. All 12 hour shifts. Sundays are time and half and any OT on your days off is double time. Bonus every 5 years. Pension plan and full benefits. Tons of vacation, paid sick days and family days. Tools provided by the company. Heavily funded schools and sports programs. Company is willing to give me 20k towards a downpayment on a home because of the welding tickets I have. The list goes on and on. 

The cons are it’s in Labrador, 560kms from any other town other than the 3 small towns in “Lab West”. It’s cold, like really really cold. -40 cold. I’m assuming things are expensive but I’m told it’s not that bad because the mine subsides the shipping costs for grocery stores and stuff like that.

wc91ye,Landlord is asking to raise rent because their mortgage cost went up,Specialist-Elk2755,Housing,1463,0.89,988,"We're in the Lower Mainland BC if it matters.

My partner and I moved into this apartment in February 2021. Because of the pandemic at the time, our rent was a fantastic deal for a pet-friendly 2 bedroom (we're both WFH). We re-signed our lease in February 2022 (with the 1.5% annual increase) and our landlord did an inspection at the time, and was very happy with how we were keeping the place.

Earlier this week, we got an email from them stating that due to rising interest rates, they would like to raise our rent ""by mutual agreement"". They asked for $500/mo more, which is more than 20%. I was pretty shocked at the audacity, but I wanted to give LL the benefit of the doubt that they were just oblivious about how outrageous of a request that was. I emailed back politely explaining that we're also feeling the pressure of inflation while planning our wedding and saving for a downpayment of our own, so while we empathize, a rent increase just wasn't in our budget.

They've since emailed back asking what we *could* afford, and I haven't responded yet.

Our rent is a steal and there isn't anything comparable on the market right now. LL is very hands off, and our intention was that this would be the last place we would rent before buying our own place in \~18 months.

On one hand, I'm pretty pissed LL thinks a mortgage we have no relation to is anything we should care about, but on the other, it's in our best interest to maintain the relationship and keep this apartment since a new place would be more expensive, and moving is costly in itself.

I'm considering emailing back and sussing out if they're at the point of considering selling, as that would mean there's a huge risk we'd be booted out if the buyer meant to live here -- I'd be willing to pay maybe $100 or $150/mo more to avoid that. I also am extremely hesitant to offer any money at all since interest rates are 100% not our problem but are being foisted onto us as our problem, and every cent we pay in more rent is less we have for two of the biggest financial life events that are coming up very quickly.

Any advice as to how to approach this? Any landlords here who could explain how dire it would have to be before you'd ask your tenant to voluntarily raise their rent? I have a feeling our LL didn't come up with this idea on their own and may be grasping at straws.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses! I've agonized on both sides of this issue for a couple of days but I think I've settled on a course of action.

As helpfully pointed out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/wc91ye/comment/iibtmp0/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I was actually misreading the tenancy act. Since nothing is free, and LL put the ball back in our court, I am going to propose an early rent increase (plus a bit) in exchange for a locked-in lease for the next 18 months without any additional increases during that time.

I still haven't decided how much we'll offer, but we will be open to negotiation in order to ensure we can stay here until we are ready to buy in early 2024. It will NOT be $500, because it would be cheaper for us to move. Since leases are non-negotiable and cannot be broken, we'd be safe and our LL can get a little bit extra beyond the mandated amount. If they must sell because the extra doesn't cover them, we'll figure it out from there, because there wouldn't have been any compromise in that case regardless.

I also want to address the fact we're getting a great deal on our current rent. Our landlord is the one that chose that amount, listed it online, and signed an agreement with us as a price they were willing to accept for the unit last year. They also chose to sign a new lease with us this year despite it being totally normal to just go month-to-month after the first lease is up. It being under market value is something our LL agreed to multiple times at multiple steps of our relationship, and market value is not particularly relevant to the issue at hand other than the fact we would be spending more money to maintain our current space and lifestyle should we need to move.",2022-07-30T18:21:41,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/wc91ye/landlord_is_asking_to_raise_rent_because_their/,

kxdlfz,My thanks to the CRA - got a big refund through Taxpayer Relief,Lab_Software,Taxes,1449,0.97,200,"Back in 2004 I decided to go back to university for another science degree (biology). For some reason I forgot to submit my T2202 forms for the tuition and textbook refund.

Totally by accident I discovered my mistake a few months ago. I contacted the university to send me the T2202 forms for the period 2004 to 2011 (the degree took a long time because I did it part time while I was working).

Then I called CRA to see what to do. The person I spoke to was super helpful, explained what to do, and emailed me all the forms I needed to fill out. He also said to send a cover letter explaining what happened and asking for Taxpayer Relief because they only have to go back 3 years.

A few months later they sent me my tax refund for the full amount - over $4000. They didn't have to, but they went back 16 years to amend my tax returns.

No one likes to pay taxes, but I've never had a bad experience with the CRA. Thanks.

wgkg29,[Small Update] Landlord Using my Unit to Charge Their EV,BALDWIN_ISNT_A_PED,Misc,1435,0.97,432,"I checked the breaker, and tested each and every single switch to see what it shuts off (as it’s unlabeled). I think I found the one that is connected to the outside port and shut that off. I’ll update here if the LL says anything :)

ETA: really hoping i turned the right one off


Edit 2 10:15am, 08/05/22: Since the lease is coming to an end soon, landlord has been wanting to discuss the future. My roommate and I have been good tenants so far with rent/hydro being on time and we’re quiet too. They want to renew with us. I’ll be bringing up the EV and update you guys on what will be said. If no resolution is found, RTB report immediately and hopefully I’ll get some money back to just stick it to them for stealing for hydro this whole year. I also set up a little contraption thing so I’ll know if they illegally entered my unit. Hopefully they don’t see it lol


Edit 2.1: They also wanted to do a walkthrough of the place and just said a day. I’m wondering if I should not let them in, even if I’m home, as it wasn’t a proper notice. They never gave a specific time, or date as a matter of fact. They just said “Walkthrough on Saturday”

Edit 3, 8/10/22: Lots have occurred within the last week. In case you guys are wondering, I’ll write up the whole story in the next day or so. There will be another conversation with the landlord hopefully today so once everything is figured out, I’ll post the update!

Edit 4, 8/12/22: I have no idea where to start, to be honest, so everything might be a little jumbled. Keep in mind all conversations whether it be with RTB or landlord have been recorded for my safety. 

First off, we had a face to face conversation regarding the hydro. They openly admitted that they have been using my unit to charge their EV for the last year and making me pay for it! We initially came up with a compromise where we pay an extra $50/month to include hydro. Furthermore, they also claimed they can raise rent by inflation + 2% (so 10% this year) and said ""Because we are nice, we will not be doing that."" I know that's all wrong and when I tried telling them legally they can only raise it by 1.5%, they said ""You are misinformed. You're wrong."" and starting shaking their head at me and very condescending. To add on, they also was forcing us to sign ANOTHER one year fixed term lease. They checked Box E of Section 2 in the lease agreement and stated ""Both LL and Tenants Agree on Fixed Terms."" However, this fixed-term is only viable in a scenario where the LL will be using the property in our case. They did not give us a 2 month notice to use the property, so it was expected that the lease will continue on month-month. 

We contacted RTB for further clarifications and found the answers we were looking for. After telling LL that we will not be signing the new lease, she was adamant that we HAVE to sign the lease, if not they will be evicting us. Once again, we clarified AGAIN with the laws and sent her all the rules / links to RTB's website regarding fixed-term tenancies. She then gave us a 5 day eviction notice via text and said ""Because you are refusing to sign the lease agreement, you must vacate the premises by Aug 15."" This text was sent on Aug 10. We stood our ground, told her no and that we will be sending her rent on the 15th to continue our lease as month-month. She then starts rambling about how frustrating this situation is for her and blah blah sends a million texts to us.

My roommate and I had a discussion, and thought maybe an 8 month agreement would be best for both parties as there would be a compromise. She would get the guaranteed money for 8 months of rent, we wouldn't have to pay for an extra 4 months while it's summer break and school's out. BIG NOPE from her end. She started venting at us again that she will be ""losing rental income during the summer"" as if that's my problem. She then wrote up a new contract for $2436 (1.5% rent increase from $2400) + $50 to include hydro. On top of this, she also added an addendum which threw in another 15 or so rules such as ""Tenant must shovel the driveway"" ""No overnight guests"" and removing wifi in the new deal. It was honestly pretty bullshit. We told her ""Okay, we do not agree to the additional rules you've put in place. We, as tenants, respectfully decline to sign the 8 month agreement and would like to invoke our rights as per RTB rules to stay month-month in our current agreement."" 

She then said ""Starting on Aug 15, you must get your own internet provider as yours will be cancelled."" 
Our original lease agreement includes internet, so by her doing this, it's quite illegal and breaching the contract. We gave a message back and said things on the line of ""Removing internet when it is included in the contract is breaching the contract, and we have legal obligations to withhold rent. Your unethical acts as a landlord have been filed to RTB and you will hear from them shortly."" 

Just now, she sent us a text saying ""We are not afraid of any legal disputes. How are you calling us unethical. We have been nothing but respectful and responsible as landlords."" And kept talking about how great landlords and great people they are. 

I have made the decision for myself and for my roommate to no longer communicate with the landlord unless there is an issue as she is clearly uneducated with the laws and obligations that her contract holds.

Lastly, we have filed a claim to RTB for the illegal use of our unit to charge their vehicle, and to compensate us for the amount we lost. I will keep updating on this post if you'd like me to. Sorry it's very jumbled but I said I'd give an update soon so here it is!

xcjux0,what can I do about this horrible RBC experience..,uwlilbaby,Banking,1432,0.95,318,"This past Friday, my sister who just turned 18 two weeks ago visited the Pickering Branch to open an RESP Account and to access the Learning Bond. She took the Government of Canada Letter that she received indicating to open an RESP account once you turn 18 to access the Learning Bond.

My sister was advised to go to the financial advisor sitting in the room. The financial advisor takes the piece of paper and expresses confusion as to why she received this letter. Then goes on to state, “this is for low income families. You know families who cannot provide food on the table and struggle to make ends meet. Why are you receiving this? you must be below the poverty line.” My sister confused, tells the advisor, this is a letter I received from the Government of Canada that states I’m eligible to do this once I am 18. 

The advisor states, “well, the RESP account is opened when parents have a new child.” “You know, when parents give birth to a child, they care for them, they visit our bank right after, and open an RESP account.” “So how come your parents didn’t do that for you?” 

My sister states, “well I wasn’t born here and my parents weren’t permanently living in Canada. They would move back n forth.”

The advisor goes on to say, “well, your parents should talk, they should talk, talk.” “I have immigrant parents and I have a RESP account.” “Your parents didn’t care.” “do you go to school?” My sister says “yes, I’m in first year of university.” The advisor asks, “are you receiving OSAP?” My sister states, “yes I am.” The advisor says, “See… low income.”

Furthermore, the advisor goes on to ask, “so what do your parents do for a living?” 
My sister says, “my mom is a teacher and my father isn’t working currently due to a lay off from COVID”
The advisor states, “yeah this is what happens when only one parent works, you end up like this.”

My sister sat in that office with a discriminating/stigmatizing financial advisor who belittled her and disrespected her parents for 40 Minutes. My sister being naive and so young didn’t know what to say. She left the office thinking negatively. The Government of Canada sent a letter advising my sister to open the RESP account. The financial advisor didn’t open the account but sat her down to tell her that our parents must not care and that we are poor, and don’t have food on the table. This advisor traumatized my young sister who is just starting her adult life and doing things on her own. I am so angry.

Edit: thank you everyone. I am so furious thinking of the things the FA told my sister and how my sister is feeling after. I will be escalating this matter. I don’t want any other young person to ever experience this. It’s sad.

(you can see the previous posts here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kutg0c/after\_10\_months\_of\_not\_paying\_rent\_i\_finally\_had/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/kutg0c/after_10_months_of_not_paying_rent_i_finally_had/)

 summary:

this person, lets call him Pumpkin Pie, rented a townhouse from me just before the pandemic, using forged credit report and employment letter. the person stopped paying rent AND utility bills immediately after he moved in February 2020 (before COVID). The eviction ban was in effect in March 2020. He first started making up random stories about how his relative kept his money etc etc... when I told him I found out his credential were all forged, he stopped responding. I phoned Toronto Police in August and supplied all the evidence. They arrested Pumpkin Pie but couldn't evict him... that's right, you absolutely need an eviction order from LTB to evict someone... Apparently, someone can run a sex trafficking ring in your house and you can't get your house back without LTB saying it's okay. I applied for an urgent hearing based on the fact that there were criminal activity in the property. I got a hearing in December 2020 and Pumpkin Pie left in Jan 2021. I was lucky because immediately after he left, Eviction Ban was re-instated. As far as I know, they only resumed evictions last week.

&#x200B;

Overall the loss was more than 34k (including rent and utilities that I had to pay for him, lol). I also had to renovate the place as the whole place was a mess. He even stole some of my furniture. Not gonna lie, even though the loss was significant, but I was just relieved that he is gone. I know so many people are struggling to get their place back. On a side note, I got a call from someone in December 2020, apparently Pumpkin Pie is trying to find a new place using fraudulent documents again. This potential landlord some how found me (probably through old rental post), and he had concerns about Pumpkin Pie. Even though it wasn't in my best interest, I told him I can't talk about it as there is currently a police investigation... that's all he needed to know. 

&#x200B;

After Pumpkin Pie left in January, I didn't hear from him again, nor from the police. I thought that was it. The crown didn't want to pursue him because the amount was immaterial. He will just take his next prey and hop around from one landlord to next and nothing will be done. **To my surprised**, I received a call from the lead investigator on the case this afternoon telling me that the crown attorney is having a meeting with his defense lawyer. He agreed to plead guilty to all charges and pay the restitution to avoid jailtime. He had to pay half ($15,000) immediately as part of the deal. And he will be registered in the system. I was totally speechless. I never thought it would get this far. I was completely stunned... and the investigator said ""you know, sometimes we do serve and protect"" :)

&#x200B;

This is pretty much the end of the story. I am not sure if Pumpkin Pie will really pay the money. But knowing that the justice system got him at the end gave me a proper closure. I remember when I spoke to the police officer in August, he said, I know what's it like out there, we received so many calls about people abusing the eviction moratorium. I have heard horror story about how some people flat out refuse to pay and trash the place. One guy intentionally left the tap on because he knows the landlord has to pay for it... it costs thousands of dollars. 

&#x200B;

Also, why did I post my story in PFC? I first posted it in r/Ontario and was told the story belongs to /toronto... so I posted in r/toronto and got my account temporarily banned... I asked mod how is this not relevant in the subreddit. he basically said, scumbag landlord... 

&#x200B;

anyways, I got a lot of messages on the eviction process and how to deal with bad tenant. feel free to shoot me a message, I will help however I can.  :)

lurqsc,PSA - You can uninstall water heater instead of buying them out for several thousand dollars,karatekid74189,Misc,1422,0.96,376,"I learned today that it's possible to cancel / close out reliance water heater contracts by simply hiring a gas technician to uninstall their tank and install your own. You're still responsible for dropping off Reliance's' tank but the cost of dropping and closing up your account is usually between $40 - $100. Much cheaper than purchasing the heater directly from a company like Reliance which can come out to several thousand dollars. They never mention this on the phone.

This is something people should possibly consider if they plan on living in their home for more than 5-10 years and are currently renting a water heater.

v6kwkl,Credit cards are trying to screw you over and hoping you don't notice!,HowIsYourHoneypot,Credit,1419,0.97,298,"Recently I received an updated Cardholder Agreement from Rogers Bank where the primary cardholder's maximum liability for the loss, theft or unauthorized use for the account went from $0 to $50.


According to Section 12 of the Cost of Borrowing Regulations associated with the Bank Act (https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2001-101/page-2.html#h-665148), the maximum liability for unauthorized use of a credit card issued by a federally regulated financial institution (FRFI) is $50. I believe this was amended in 2019 but credit card issuer companies only started changing now.


This means that if a consumer is found liable for a transaction, they must pay the lesser of $50 and the maximum set by the credit agreement.


This used to be covered with Visa/Mastercard zero liability most credit cards offered but lately the financial institutions have been amending their credit agreements placing the onus of the first $50 on the consumer - examples being the Rogers Mastercards and all CIBC/Simplii Visa cards.


I am sending a letter to my MP to ask them to work to reduce this unfair cost to the consumer as the onus shouldn’t be on the consumer who has no ability to approve or deny the transaction itself. This will hurt all credit card using Canadians who shouldn’t be expected to review their credit card transactions daily while removing the onus from the multi billion dollar corporations (Banks and credit card issuers - Visa and Mastercard).

Edit: to be clear, even if you report a fraudulent transaction(s) at any time including once you review your monthly statement, you are on the hook for the first $50.

I would personally be ok with this scheme if approval for any transactions were text or push notifications to my phone or email.

pfwrmu,How a $10 toilet part has cost us thousands in excess water use,,Misc,1412,0.97,247,"Our water bill has always been ~$300 every two months ever since moving in two years ago. That should have been a huge red flag to me but truthfully I just set up the account and enabled automatic payments and didn't bother checking. We're immigrants and just assumed that was a normal water bill here in Ontario, Canada.

Well we just got our latest bill and it's for about $450. Obviously this struck me as odd so I went digging. Since we have a smart meter it reports usage every hour, and this can be aggregated to daily, monthly, etc. I can see that half way through July our usage shot up and stayed that way since then. This screamed leak to me, so I went hunting around the house for the culprit. Eventually after lifting the lid on all the toilet cisterns I found that the downstairs toilet is leaking. It will drain about 2 inches of water and then refill itself, over and over again, constantly. It's a bad rubber flapper. It has deteriorated and caused a significant leak. It's a very quiet toilet and we weren't exactly listening out for it constantly refilling the tank, and we really don't use it all that much, so we never noticed. I thought ""I'll just get a new flapper, they're $10 from Home Depot, it sucks that we paid $150 extra for water but shit happens"".

That got me thinking about our regular bill... $300 seems high, no? So I Googled. Reddit threads said people's average bills were like $100, $150 max. Oh shit. I went and looked at our usage again from last year, way before this leak happened. I looked at the hourly usage. We were using almost exactly the same amount of water during the night hours (12am-7am) than we were in the afternoon hours when a shower/dishwasher/washing machine etc wasn't running. FUCK! This leak has been costing us for YEARS. Only a month and a half ago did it deteriorate to the point of being noticeable. Our water has had a baseline level of usage, every hour around the clock, for two years just from this one leak.

So I figure with the amount we were paying for water over the average for a 2 bedroom household, over a 2 year period, this $10 toilet part has cost us thousands of dollars in excess water use that we just never noticed.

Not really sure why I'm posting this, except I think I need to laugh at it as a coping mechanism, and I figure a subreddit for the financially conscious would appreciate a laugh and somebody new to be the butt of the jokes.

The engineer in me is now wondering why water companies don't monitor for a very steady baseline level of usage, especially through the night hours, and send a polite letter or email warning the home owner there might be a leak... I'm sure it's not in their best interest to sell less of what makes them money, but this is a huge waste of water.",2021-09-01T11:55:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/pfwrmu/how_a_10_toilet_part_has_cost_us_thousands_in/,

12spoci,Telus 1.5% CC fee. I complained to the CRTC and its being investigated. Looking for advice.,Ryzer32,Credit,1411,0.98,286,"I complained to Telus when I started getting charged the 1.5% fee for paying my bill with my credit card. The Telus rep said the the fee would ultimately continue. I wasn't happy with that, so I complained to the CRTC. Well, the CCTS got back to me. the CCTS reviewed my complaint and Telus initially tried to reject to my complaint, but the CCTS objected Telus's rejection and ultimately it's going ahead.

The complaint now remains open at the pre-investigation stage. Telus then reached out to me offering a lump sum credit of 2 years worth of this fee (about 45$) to attempt a resolution. Accepting this would resolve my complaint. If I don't accept the offer from Telus, the CCTS will assign an investigator and they will work with me and Telus to address the complaint.

According to Telus, the Credit card fees are not a part of my service agreement so the CCTS typically closes these complaints. Also the CCTS cannot dictate to Telus how to run their business.

I emailed the CCTS about the situation and advice of what to do, it's been a few days and they haven't gotten back to me. I did watch the simple intro video from the CCTS website which did help me understand the process [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpTA4orOQQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lpTA4orOQQ)

Really I'd like to try to stop this 1.5% CC fee from being charged to Canadians. I could pass up the 45$ to try to make it happen. But if it wont matter anyway maybe I should take my 45$ and resolve the complaint with Telus.

1lubwm4,"Bell gave me a “free SIM” as a newcomer, then trashed my credit. I fought back — and won.",Tough-Assistant7509,Credit,1397,0.94,120,"Post:
I want to share my experience as a newcomer to Canada who trusted a “free SIM” offer from Bell and ended up with damaged credit. It’s taken months of fighting, but I finally got the negative credit reporting removed — and I hope this helps someone else avoid the same trap.

Here’s what happened:
	•	I arrived in Canada and received a SIM card from Bell as part of an Air Canada newcomer package. It was clearly labeled as “free”, and I was told I could cancel at any time. No contract, no strings — or so I thought.
	•	I never used the SIM and assumed it was a prepaid or trial offer. I was also told there would be no credit check — which Bell’s website even confirmed.
	•	Fast forward a year later: I get contacted by CBV Collections about a $129 balance for a Bell account I never knowingly used. This was the first time I ever heard that the account was still active or that I owed anything.
	•	I paid the balance in full immediately, in good faith, just to close the matter. But a few days later, I checked my credit report and saw that Bell had reported 3 missed payments and associated the account with a Toronto address I’ve never lived at. I’ve only lived in Montreal.
	•	My credit was damaged for something I didn’t even know existed.

Bell initially refused to do anything about it, telling me the reporting was “valid.” They ignored the fact that:
	•	I was new to Canada
	•	I had no internet access when I arrived
	•	I was misled about the SIM being “free”
	•	I never received a single bill or email
	•	I thought it was prepaid

I filed a complaint with the CCTS (Commission for Complaints for Telecom-television Services), escalated the matter, and fought back hard.

Eventually, after a “high-level complaint” (as they called it), Bell agreed to remove all negative credit reporting. But they would’ve never done that had I not fought back.

⸻

Lessons for anyone new to Canada (or anyone dealing with Bell):
	•	If you get a “free SIM,” ask explicitly if it’s prepaid or postpaid. Don’t trust vague marketing.
	•	Always ask if a credit check is involved, even if the site says otherwise.
	•	If you’re sent to collections unfairly, pay it if necessary — but fight for your credit.
	•	Use the CCTS. It’s free, and it works if you stay persistent.

* 10k in RRSP
* 3k in crypto
* Car worth approximately 22k at this moment

Liabilities:

* Most of my RRSP money is from a previous employer that offered 1:1 matching.  I've since put in a tiny bit of money for tax benefits, my income is high enough that it offers me a lot more net gain than a TFSA ever could.
* I only put in $1500 into Bitcoin and Etherium throughout the last year.  Cashed out Bitcoin recently at 3k profit, and kept my Ethereum which only has $500 of my own money originally invested.
* I keep 14k in cash as an E-fund to cover emergencies (i.e. job loss), and to cover my normal cash outflow (credit cards, rent, etc).

For items over $10, you are entitled to receive a discount.",dont_worry_be_nappy,Meta,1383,0.93,202,"**TLDR:** As per the [*Scanner Price Accuracy Code*](https://www.retailcouncil.org/scanner-price-accuracy-code/), implemented in June 2002, Canadian consumers are eligible to receive items valued at $10 or under for free from most major retailers (see full list below) if the item is not scanned at the advertised price during checkout. If the item is valued over 10$, the consumer is entitled to a $10 reduction of the final price of the item. *This code does not apply to retailers in Québec.

**Preface**

The motivation for writing this post stems from my hatred for Loblaws. I hate Loblaws. It boils up from deep within me, a hate steeped in rage and brewed to odious perfection. A hate that incessantly seeps from my every orifice as water from a wicker basket, which is of such profound clarity and power that at its very mention the world quakes. Anyways, I digress.

Loblaws doesn't have the best reputation. Their prices are high, quality of products generally low, [they were eager to cancel the 'pandemic hero pay' program](https://financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/union-slams-loblaw-over-pandemic-pay-as-company-reports-nearly-400m-profit) for their employees despite posting record profits in 2020, and of course the [bread price fixing scandal.](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/loblaw-parent-company-alerted-competition-watchdog-to-bread-price-fixing/article37387816/)

Despite all of the above criticism, I admit that I regularly shop at Loblaws out of convenience. However, during my last several trips, more than once during checkout one or more items scanned at prices higher than were advertised in the flyer. If I wasn't paying attention, I would have never noticed. Whenever this happens, I simply let the associate know, and they adjust the price to the advertised price. No big deal, fine. Mistakes happen. 

But given the frequency of this occurrence, I decided to look into it further to see if any compensation is available - low and behold, there is, but it is of course not advertised. Fortunately, I am in a position that saving a few dollars is not a massive deal, but for many Canadians it can make a huge impact in their weekly budget. Therein lies my reasoning for sharing this information with you all (and because Loblaws deserves a taste of their own medicine).

While the Code has made the odd appearance [here and there in the media](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/scanner-price-accuracy-voluntary-code), it is not generally not well known.

**The Bottom Line**

The Scanner Price Accuracy Code, implemented in June 2002, is a voluntary code to ensure scanner price accuracy for consumers.

This Code applies to all scanned merchandise sold in all participating stores with a Universal Product Code (UPC), bar code, and Price Look-Up (PLU). It does not include price-ticketed items or goods not easily accessible to the public. Since its creation, over 7,000 stores across Canada have joined the Scanner Price Accuracy Code.

If you notice that an item scans incorrectly, you should notify the cashier. Once the cashier is notified, the cashier should follow the store’s procedures in resolving the issue. If the item is applicable for the code, you should either be given the item for free, or $10 off the displayed price.

- If the display price is less than $10, the customer should receive the item for free. If more than one of the same item is being purchased, the customer receives the first one for free, and subsequent items with the same UPC should be priced according to the display.

- If the display price is more than $10, the customer should receive $10 off the displayed price. If more than one of the same item is being purchased, the customer receives $10 off the first item, and subsequent items with the same UPC should be priced according to the display.

You can also contact the store or their customer service department after a purchase has been made. A receipt will be required if you are claiming the Scanner Price Accuracy Code after a completed purchase.

13tb7or,The Ten Commandments of R/PFC,midnightmoose,Meta,1374,0.95,165,"Having spent too much time on this forum (both in years and in hours) there are a few often repeated, seemingly immutable answers to common questions that come up here in this group.  Whether they are accurate or groupthink sometimes you can decide. It might be helpful to give a quick rundown for anyone new to this forum or who only checks it casually.

1.) If it involves gift cards, it is a scam. Late payment to the CRA? Scam. Friends needs cash but can only accept gift cards? Scam. Your uncle, who doesn’t speak to you often, awkwardly gives you 25$ worth of iTunes money because he didn’t know what to pick out for you? Probably a scam as well!

2.) The boyfriend (its always a boyfriend) who wants to “buy a property” with you but needs you to pay for the entire downpayment will inevitably leave you and try and wrongly claim half.

3.) The parents who want to add you onto their mortgage “to help you build credit” will leave you financially ruined and unable to qualify for a mortgage on your own.

5.) You must abandon Toronto. All family, friends, cultural ties or workplace opportunities need to be sacrificed at the alter if you want to realistically own real estate.

6.) You trying to time the market is about as useful as my toddler trying to read the hands on clock, yeah she can you tell you if its currently pointed up or down but has no ability to know what that means.

7.) You can invest in either -EQT/-GRO ETFs, GICs or HISAs otherwise we will dance on your grave when you face inevitable ruin for your market speculation.

8.) Owning a rental property is the most labour intensive decision you can make and you are a veritable demon for what you have done to our housing market (…but we’ll just gloss over the fact that if you did it between 2008-2021 you were likely very successful and made off with boat loads of money from it)

9.) Instead of asking strangers what to do with you inheritance, it would be nice for just one person to offer to etransfer it to us collectively as a gift.

Due to the massive rise in food prices in early 2020, I had to increase my food budget by 50% *and* decrease the quality of my food. My total yearly expenses increased from 11k to 12.5k, with **food now accounting for 36% of my total expenses**.

Now it's 2021. Prices have increased a bit further, but really it's the lowered food quality that has become unsustainable. I've had to raise my food budget again. I wanted to raise it from 4.5k to 6k, but oddly that's just not making that much of a difference, so I'm thinking of raising it to 7.5k (about 20.50 dollars a day). I've also raised by entertainment expenses by 450 dollars a year (I got into photography, shit's expensive). My total yearly expenses now add up to 16k (up from 11k just two years before!), **47% of which goes to food**.

l2wdhg,The Problems with the Financial Advice industry - From the Inside.,CFAsmalltown,,1348,0.97,334,"Hey all,

&#x200B;

Just one of your resident anonymous financial advisors here. I wanted to lay out some information that many of you may find helpful.

For reference, I run a wealth management firm & personal income tax firm. I am IIROC licensed, life licensed, have a BBA degree and hold the CFA designation & a litany of other useless titles. This account is anonymous and is not being used to find clients, I simply ignore any DM requests related to this.

I know there is a massive hate for financial advisors here, and frankly its well deserved. 

I wanted to talk about the problems with the industry, why they exist, and why most people have a bad experience with a financial advisor.

Let me start by prefacing this and saying that I fundamentally believe 90% advisors are salespeople, 5% are scammers and 5% are actually doing a good job for their clients. 

Now, let's talk about why 90% of the advisor are salespeople. Well, 90% of the clients who work with advisors have small accounts & as such pay very little.

Let's consider a median account size, of say $20,000 in a banks investment products. You might think that's low but seriously what do you think the average Canadian has in investments? It's likely this is in a bank's product charging a 2.3% MER. But for this example, lets assume the advisor is independent and makes nothing on the banks end of things. Out of this 2.3% the advisor is likely paid a 1% trailer fee. On $20,000 that would pay a gross commission to the advisor of $200. Now, the advisors firm is going to take a cut of that, and it's likely around 40% (More successful advisors pay a lower rate, we pay 20% but average is probably 40%). Meaning the advisor gets $120 per year in revenue to manage this account. 

Now this $120 is before they pay their staff, their rent, software costs, phone bill, internet etc etc etc. Meaning that the actual gross profit an advisor might make on this could easily be less than $50. Their team may spend anywhere from 3-10 hours per year on this account. Meaning at the high end they make $16.67 an hour and on the low end $5 per hour.

This is what causes such a problem in the industry. In the first place, the vast majority of Canadians are not willing to pay for financial advice. Even if they desperately needed it. If the advisor tried to charge an hourly fee or anything along those lines, it is likely the % fee would be substantially higher for the client at the end of the day. 

So what does an advisor do? Well most advisors forgo spending a ton of time promoting good advice and rather collect as many accounts as they can. Since they are making next to nothing per hour of work on the smaller accounts, they have to offset this by making more on larger accounts. 

This is fundamentally why the majority of financial institutions do not bother fully training their financial advisor staff as it is nearly impossible to be profitable for them providing proper financial planning and advice to the majority of the population. They train them to sell profitable products instead, as the products can be profitable while the advice industry is not outside of the High Net Worth segment.

&#x200B;

This leads to the population that most needs proper financial advice, being unable to receive it and receiving crappy advice and expensive investment products instead. As it is the only method that major financial institutions have found to make this demographic profitable. 

Since the majority can not afford proper advice, they receive crappy advice. Since the majority receive crappy advice, the industry as a whole provides crappy advice. The industry receives a bad reputation, which it deserves.

&#x200B;

To give you perspective, this is what I do with a $100,000 client:

We meet for 30 minutes to interview for the first time. They book a second meeting of an hour to go over the details, what we charge etc. They call us to confirm they want to move their accounts over. We send them a list of questions we need answered so we can prepare the paperwork. 

We spend 1 to 3 hours preparing the paperwork depending on the complexity. We then sit down and meet with the client for another hour to go over and sign off on the paperwork. We then arrange a phone call or meeting to go over the clients financial goals and objectives. This is usually an hour. 

Then we spend 3 or 4 hours preparing a financial plan for the client to reach their goals and objectives. Then we spend an hour going over the financial plan with our client. It likely requires some revisions, so we spend an hour making alterations to it. We then spent 30 minutes reviewing the amended plan with the client. 

If the client approves, we then design an investment portfolio to meet the return & risk objections from the financial plan. Average of 3 hours, some take 15 minutes, some take 20 hours+ depending on complexity. 

From there we sell off their existing portfolio, and buy their new portfolio. Which takes 2 hours on average. Once that is all complete we spend up to 2 hours reviewing the accounts to ensure all the money has arrived properly, the portfolio was purchased accordingly and no errors or omissions have taken place. Then we prepare the compliance paperwork for the portfolio which can take an hour. 

So far, 19.5 hours spent. $100,000 pays us 1%, and our dealer takes 20%, leaving us with $800 or $41 per hour. Now remember, this $41 per hour is simply my revenue. I have full time staff, rent, software costs, standard office overhead (heat, phone, internet). My share of business expenses run at about $48 per hour. My rent is only $600 a month as my business partner owns the building. Most advisors likely have a higher overhead than I do.

So for this client, it has cost me $7 per hour to provide them with proper financial advice. Now, it is likely that the number of hours required yearly after this drops down to 10 hours a year. The only reason I even take on an account of this size is if they are saving regularly and I can see their account being worth $500,000 in the future as that would allow me to be profitable for managing their account. 

This is the entire problem with the financial advice industry. The regulatory, compliance, administrative overhead costs are so high that I can only provide proper advice to those that already have enough money. The result of all the excess costs designed to protect consumers, is worse and worse advice being given to those that need it most.

&#x200B;

This is why the majority of financial institutions provide crappy advice, & use high fee products. It is why if you can learn to manage your financial affairs you should. However many people should note that simply because your situation is easy to learn  does not mean it is easy to learn how to manage every single persons financial situation. 

Even with that being said, every single piece of research I have ever read has shown that investors behavioural biases detract from performance more than high fees do. Every investor assumes this is not them. Most investors are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Spend the time learning how to invest properly, do it yourself and the majority will suffer behavioural pitfalls detracting from performance.  Or get lumped in with an advisor who may charge you too high a fee, receive low quality advice, but potentially eliminate some of your behavioural pitfalls.  Roboadvisors can work for some people, but I still see people making behavioural mistakes with roboadvisors. Waiting to put money in until the markets at a ""good point"", or changing their risk tolerance at terrible times. 

&#x200B;

This is not to say that I am complaining as an advisor, or that you can't find a good advisor. These are all generalities and are not applicable to every situation. I can only speak in broad strokes as your situation is likely unique. I make a good income for my level of qualification and have no complaints. However I see the average advice provided by my industry and it appalls me. Its why I understand the hate for my industry in the general community. 

&#x200B;

Let me know if you have any questions, I would love to discuss potential solutions to these issues.",2021-01-22T15:33:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/l2wdhg/the_problems_with_the_financial_advice_industry/,
vgya5q,DO NOT bank with tangerine. It is not worth it.,DonutSlave,,1342,0.83,544,"Coming to vent some frustration in the hope that it saves other folks some trouble. I'm also curious if anyone else is having this experience.

I'm a long-time Tangerine Customer (from the ING days) and used to rave about them. Loved the high level of service and online-only offering.

In the last \~6 months, the service has become unusable.

Every month or so, completely routine transactions get flagged (for example, an e-transfer to my girlfriend). Tangerine then completely freezes all of my accounts and locks me out of online banking. This includes freezing any recurring bill payments.

To resolve the reversal, I have to call their phone line  (no online option to verify transactions) and have to sit on hold for >30 minutes listening to the ONE song that they play on a loop (no option for a callback when they reach your place in line, or even to sit in silence).

The first-line representatives are unable to address frozen accounts so they have to transfer you to the security team. Often, I am simply told that unfortunately nobody is available from that team and I need to call back later.

Effectively Tangerine is arbitrarily forcing me to spend several hours of my time - whenever they want -  waiting around on them.

All the while - my accounts are completely frozen. I've missed Mortgage payments because it was impossible to contact someone at Tangerine to unlock my accounts. 

DO NOT bank with them. Absolute nightmare.

Is anyone else experiencing this?

EDIT: In the comments it looks like other folks have seen the same issue, but it seems rare. Given the fact this isn’t isolated, I’d stand by my title. 

FYI - finally got someone on the phone. All of my accounts were frozen, and my online banking access revoked because of a $180 dollar e-transfer to a new recipient. Customer service were accusatory and argumentative and expected me to provide detailed transaction history in order to unlock my account - even though they had locked me out of online banking. All in all, it seemed extremely unreasonable and unpleasant. 

I’ll be closing my accounts.",2022-06-20T18:56:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/vgya5q/do_not_bank_with_tangerine_it_is_not_worth_it/,
mzy0nu,My real estate agent represented another buyer in a bidding war I put a bid in,PFCThrowawayMontreal,Housing,1340,0.98,265,"Based in QC.

Basically, I put in a bid on a house using my agent. I didn't get it, and I moved on to another house. I learned this week that the winning bid was placed by the same duo of agents I used (2 agents, who claim to work as a team and advertise together), and no one had cared to notify me of the conflict of interest. When I confronted my agent, she claimed there was no issue as technically her partner was the agent of the winning bid, but I feel uneasy as they pitted their clients against one another.

First of all, isn't this some sort of ethical violation? My offer was not competitive, but I figure my agent pressured me into submitting it to put pressure on the other buyer who was competitive (there were only 3 offers on the home). It's also possible that the information regarding both clients' respective bids were communicated.

Second, if this is some sort of ethical violation, what recourse do I have?

I have seen everything from fire works to crazy balloons flying away in the sky but never have I seen these lights. Now I at first thought maybe it’s a fire, but the light moves in weird ways. I’m sure it’s nothing but it is still very strange. After I stopped recording it had stopped. 

I’m sure there’s an explanation but I was just curious if anyone has seen these lights before. Cause in the 2 years I’ve been here I have never seen this before.  So please let me know if you know what the hell this is lol

1fnnzsc,Mon experience au Quebec (je viens de Texas),Pale_Field4584,,310,0.99,33,"Salut, je voulais partager mon experience lorsque je suis allée au Quebec l'aneee dernière justement pendant ce période d'automne. J'ai conduit de Texas pour voir l'automne pour la premiere fois dans ma vie. J'ai visité la ville de Quebec (et quelques parcs nationals + Montreal).

J'habite à Brownsville, TX, c'est à cote du Mexique (je suis originalement du Mexique). Je blague avec mon mari que je parle a peine l'anglais et je veux déjà dominer le français. Le français qu'on apprendre à l'école est avec l'accent français. Donc, le québécois fut très difficile pour moi à suivre car j'ai eu aucune exposition. Mais j'en m'ai débrouillée et je suis très fier de moi de mener à bien plusieurs de conversations. Sauf une occasion a Montreal qu'un barista n'a pas eu la patience de continuer en français :(

D'abord la premiere chose que j'ai remarqué c'est que dans notre camping il y a avait 2 our 3 personnes qui sont entre dans notre place pour nous demander si nous sommes vraiment de Texas et si nous avons vraiment conduit jusqu'ici xD et une personne m'avait demande qqc de Formula 1 mais j'y sais rien.

Puis nous sommes allées dans un autre parc plus isole et lorsque j'ai gare la voiture je m'apercois d'un groupe qui fixent une regarde dans les plaques de ma voiture et rigolent. Je me sentais un [un peu comme ca](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.zfYGGvnTIx_AmxNqo_-bfQHaFj?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain). Le plus que je conduisais j'ai remarqué qu'il avait très peu d'autres Américains. Ça m'a étonnée je croyais que le Quebec était un endroit très populaire pour voir l'automne, mais dans plusieurs fois ce me semblait d'etre la seule Américaine dans les parcs.

Je crois que mon moment préféré fut quand je me promenais dans le Walmart et une femme âgée avait besoin d'aide à lire une etiquette. Et quand j'ai demandé à un personnel de Walmart s'il avait de ""chorizo"" il m'a regardé stupéfait et puis appelai le manager pour m'aider. J'ai dit ""Non, non, ca fait rien! merci!!"" Puis il appelé la manager de toutes façons et elle n'a pas aucune idee de quoi je parle. C'etait trop gênant xD

En fin, j'ai trouvé le Quebec extrêmement beau. C'est comme l'Europe mais avec les avantages d'Amerique du Nord (belle nature, vaste espaces, bus scolaires). J'adore l'aestetique des maisons et leur deco d'Halloween. C'etait une experience belle et rafraichissant. (Je venais du Toronto et jai pas aimé. Toronto était completement different de ce que j'imaginais).

Quand je suis arrivée a Nouvelle Angleterre je suis choquée de la quantité immense de touristes a Vermont et autres parcs pour voir l'automne la. C'etait pas agréable dans plusieurs occasions et tous les influencers qui dansaient avec les feuilles était trop cringe xD",2024-09-23T12:00:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/1fnnzsc/mon_experience_au_quebec_je_viens_de_texas/,

1lsac8n,Highlights of our visit,Traditional_Wave_322,,242,0.99,31,"Bonjour Reddit! My family just left Quebec and we absolutely loved it! Wanted to share some highlights to maybe help future travelers.

We did 4 days in Montreal first and honestly much preferred Quebec. We live in NYC and Montreal was a bit too “big city” for me to feel relaxed. Quebec was a whole different world and so great.

We stayed at the Palace Royal hotel which was a great location. Right on St Jean but not in the busiest area, so very easy to walk everywhere but enough removed. The pool and hot tub were great.

Besides when we took the city bus to Montmorency Falls, we walked everywhere. We’re New Yorkers so used to walking, but the Quebec hills were a serious workout, but also made it fun and adventurous. (Side note: how do residents do it in the winter???? I would slip 😂). 

For restaurants, we loved Billig (amazing crepes!), Grillades Yekalbe (African restaurant), and L’Antiquaire Buffet. We enjoyed the ambiance at La Cuisine for a change of pace but the food was just okay. We went to L’Entrecote St Jean because I wanted steak and that was just okay. We really regretted going to La Bûche because it was overpriced and not that great, but we fell for the tourist trap I guess 😂. 

We did not plan our trip to be during the FEQ but we were so glad we were there! We saw two great shows at the Hydro Quebec stage.

En générale, we loved Quebec and thought it was a really special place. I love speaking French and I found it frustrating in Montreal how no matter how hard I tried everyone would respond to me in English 😂 and I really appreciated how in Quebec people were more willing to let me speak.

Thanks for a great trip Quebec!!!!",2025-07-05T09:50:20,https://i.redd.it/q5weni7y82bf1.jpeg,

1m01uy6,An American's endless thank you to your beautiful city,Dangerous_Wear3756,,209,0.98,12,"Merci Beaucoup!

I visited your city last week and it was one of the best trips I've had in such a long time, if not in all of my days. Not only was it absolutely beautiful, but it was filled with some of the kindest people I have ever met. I wanted to practice my French while I was up there and everyone was so patient and understanding when I stumbled over a word or two.

I also unknowingly happened to be up there during the FEQ and am a *huge* music fan. I had no idea Hozier was playing the day I was in the city and I stumbled across the sign and my mouth fell to the floor. I of course immediately checked to see if there were any tickets left and couldn't seem to find any online, but as I was walking away I decided to ask a group of girls if they knew if the show was sold out. They said the think so, but that they HAVE AN EXTRA ONE!!! They gave me an extra pass and I ended up going to the show that night. It was one of the most magical experiences of my life, and a true testament to the kindness of everyone living in Quebec City.

  
Here's some other things I also noticed that were so refreshing during my stay:

* Your public bathrooms are some of the cleanest I have ever seen. Even on the trailheads in Jaques-Cartier? I could barely even tell that I was in a bathroom. Truly remarkable. You step foot in a stall like that at a trailhead in the states and you are *holding your breath* for the entire time you're in there.
* On that note, the cleanliness everywhere was actually unparalleled.
* The pace everywhere felt slowed and not rushed. The second you get on the roads in the states it's like people think it's a race to get to their destination. I didn't feel that way driving around Quebec City--even just around Quebec in general for that matter. It's like there was a big sigh of calm up there (this might be a bias of my own because I was on vacation, but hey).
* People were so *kind* to one another. As I mentioned, I wanted to practice my French while I was up there and everyone was so patient, understanding, and kind while I worked my way through what I was trying to say. Not only that, but people were in general just kind to one another as well. On the streets, in the restaurants, at the festivals, you name it. It truly felt like you could walk up to anyone and they were your neighbor. People *wanted* to help you out and chat with you.

Here was my itinerary in case you're looking for ideas on what to do:

* Monday:
   * Drove for 12 hours
* Tuesday:
   * Canyon Sainte-Anne
   * Chute Jean Larose
   * Montmorency Falls
* Wednesday:
   * Jacques-Cartier National Park
   * Hiked Les Cascades Trail
   * Kayaked in the Park
   * Dinner on Ile d'Orleans
* Thursday:
   * Explored ALL of Quebec City
   * WAS GIVEN A FREE PASS TO SEE HOZIER!!
   * SAW HOZIER IN QUEBEC CITY??!!
* Friday:
   * Explored Chaudière Falls Park
   * Drove to the Thousand Islands
* Saturday:
   * Took a cruise around the Thousand Islands
   * Drove Back

You are blessed with some incredible places and incredible people and I truly can't wait until I have the opportunity to come back and visit again.

MERCI BEAUCOUP!!

Pardon me if this is an over-exaggeration, and I’m sure it is to some extent — but I was struck with the well-deserved PRIDE you all seem to have in your home. As an American visiting on July 4, it made a particular impression. I am, on the whole, more ashamed than proud of the US and its legacy — and in contrast, I found your apparent pride to be very very special.

1lhyl7q,Recent Visit to Québec — Merci beaucoup,Sour_Orange_Peel,,136,0.98,24,"Bonjour All!

I’m an American who booked an impromptu trip to your lovely city. I didn’t realize it was under 6 hour drive (from suburb of Boston) and lovely drive it is through New Hampshire and Vermont.



I had no expectations, besides French everywhere, and to get my husband escargot raisins at a patisserie that reminded him of his childhood (in Haiti).



Your city blew me away! I can’t believe this amazing place is so close by. There really is a little bit of everything, arts, music, architecture, food, hiking, nature. Before our trip we searched Reddit and YouTube for recommendations, and I will say most of your recs are top notch.

What we did:
- Walked around Saint Louis, Chateau Frontenac, Petit Champlain, Terasse Dufferin, Plains of Abraham just admiring the architecture and greenery of your beautiful city

- Montmorency Falls and walking trails


- Basilica at St Anne de Beaupre


- Drove around Ile de Orleans


- listened to random music performances throughout the city


- strolled through a country/rodeo festival


- Observatory Tower


What we ate:
- Chouquette on Saint Jean: loved the pavlova, cinnamon roll, and puff pastry with crème. The other pastries we tried were okay.


- Paillard: tried an apple pastry, and a chocolate pastry. This place felt like fast food a little bit


- La Buche: LOVED the onion soup, the I other dishes were fine. Good high quality fresh ingredients, but honestly tasted like typical Midwest American food to me 😬


- Random Creperie in Petit Champlain: got savory crepes, they were good and fresh! Perfect snack for mid day.


- Chez Buldoc: Poutine. I was told the cheese needed to be squeaky. This place had it, but I did not understand what it meant. I didn’t like it at all. Not sure if I don’t like poutine or maybe the place. Had a fun time trying to understand each others French here 😆


- Attaboy: nice pizza by the slice
- la croquembouche: this had the escargot raisins that reminded my husband of his childhood. We have tried so many around Boston and they’re always too sweet or the raisins lack the taste he is looking for. We loved the pastries here and came back again.


- La Affaire est Ketchup: came here cause I loved the concept and Anthony Bourdain. Blown away. Loved everything I ate and enjoyed every minute of the experience here. Tried ris d’agneau and I literally wanted to lick the plate. We got so lucky, as I booked the reservation literally one hour before our seating.


- mango tea: got bubble tea and banh mi. The beef one was good but the tuna was meh. Bubble tea is standard.


- sooo much ice cream, I don’t even remember which ones we went to. We tried some soft serve goat milk in petit Champlain that was lovely. Chocolate with almond at a chocolate shop. Hazelnuts and straciatella gelato as well. I lost track. There were all good!


- strawberry and maple slushees on Ile de Orleans. Soooo delicious and fresh. We met a lovely women who owned the farm (I think it was Gosselin) and they had an inflatable strawberry as well.


Everyone we met was so helpful, kind and patient. My husband speaks French but it’s been long since he spoke it with anyone, and I will say people were excited and open to speaking with him in French. I was told many will default to English if they know it’s easier,  but I didn’t find that to be the case here. We truly appreciated everyone’s patience and hospitality.


We were fortunate enough to stay at a true bed a breakfast that had a hospitable and helpful staff and made some delicious breakfast for us each day.


The sheer diversity of people, landscape, and things to do shocked me! Canada is such a huge country and Québec City is nothing like my experiences in Toronto/Mississauga, Niagara, or Thousand Islands. Seeing young people and children out and about, living, trying things on their own was amazing coming from an American where kids are barely allowed to play on their yards alone. On our first day out, two random kids who were clearly under the age of 10, asked us where the library was. I know it seems trivial, but your city has opened up my mind on what kind of life to seek out back in Massachusetts. At no point did it feel unsafe, despite being out late in more residential areas. I’m sure like anywhere else there is crime and problems, but overall I loved this city and can’t wait to come back.


I’m racking my brain to think of a downside, and my guess would be the winters are quite harsh and dark. That being said, we met some other tourists who come to the winter festival each year, and are intrigued to come back to see.


Merci beaucoup for a wonderful experience ❤️🙏🏽",2025-06-22T17:02:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/1lhyl7q/recent_visit_to_québec_merci_beaucoup/,

And sorry for murdering french every time I opened my mouth and tried to speak it!

I’m American-born though my mom is from New Brunswick. I heard great things about Quebec City so I wanted to see it. My mom had bad experiences when she was a kid and her family moved to Quebec - she and her siblings had rocks thrown at them because they didn’t speak french. No surprise they didn’t stay in Quebec for long.

As a result my mom didn’t understand why I wanted to go but I often do things my mom doesn’t understand. Ha!

Anyway, I’ve spent 5 days here - stayed in an Airbnb in St-Roch and had an absolutely fantastic time. Walking everywhere was so easy, buses were very convenient, food and drink were great, and I was treated with nothing but warmth and kindness (and maybe pity with my bad French). While I’m not sure I can convince my mom to come visit I have plenty of friends that I have.

10vuxt8,Merci beaucoup Québec!,JustCapreseSalad,,108,1.0,12,"Salut!

I made the trip up from Montreal this weekend to experience my first Carnaval (and my first trip to your city in general!). I had a lot of fun both at Carnaval and sightseeing around your beautiful city! You were all very kind and friendly, and made me feel very welcomed in your city. I was nervous my lack of French would not stand me in good stead, and having been drip-fed stories of Quebeckers despising the British for historical reasons I was worried me being an obviously accented Englishman would not make me very popular. I learnt this weekend that that is, as we say in England, bollocks. Every Quebecker I spoke to was curious to see what I was doing so far from home (although home these days is Montreal), and wanted to show me as much of your beautiful culture as possible! I admit the frigid temperatures on Saturday were not pleasant, but I’m pleased to say that was the only negative aspect of the trip!

I’m back home in Montreal now one extra arrow sash in hand and one more Canadian city ticked off the bucket list. I’m not sure when I’ll next be back, but I hope it isn’t too long before I get to do a deeper dive of your wonderful city.

If you read it and have suggestions to add/try next time, feel free to send a DM or comment. Below is some highlights at a glance. From a tourist's POV.

1)**Old Quebec 5-course gourmet food and historical tour** \- Why?

It's our favorite way to explore any new place. Especially if you do it on day one.

You get a lay of the land, learn the history, taste food, and have a knowledgeable local to ask  
questions, and get tips from. This is my best travel tip to anyone, anywhere.

Then all **Old Quebec City** is charming AF. Quartier Petit Champlain is where most of those photos are taken. It feels like you're in a snow globe. I'd recommend getting some lightweight crampons you can slip over your shoes. Two spots are steep, and slippy.

**Ice Canoeing** \- I learned Quebec City is the only place in the world you can do it  
as a tourist. Super fun, quite challenging. Staff is phenomenal. - Tour Company [https://canotaglaceexperience.ca/](https://canotaglaceexperience.ca/)

Afterwards, I'd go to **Strom Spa** to recover/relax.

I particularly LOVED the **Christmas Village (Nov. 24th-dec 24th** it's huge and incredibly fun) and hear  
**Carnival is amazing. February 7-16th** this year. Carnival info - [https://carnaval.qc.ca/en/](https://carnaval.qc.ca/en/)

**FOOD**

Restaurant **Le Continental** \- Upscale they cook it table side. Wonderful ambiance.

Restaurant **La Bûche** \- Great atmosphere, local dishes like meat pie, baked beans (top off with maple syrup), and try chick pea soup.

***Restaurant Alentours*** (715 Saint-Bernard St). This restaurant focuses on locally sourced products and sustainability.

1608 **Bar** at Château Frontenac for a cocktail at least once.

I'm realizing there's a lot of good food and the names are hard to remember, the blog post will have a lot more restaurants.

**MICROBREWERIES**

If you’re into microbreweries check out the lower part of Quebec City in the Saint-Roch district. We went to ***Noctem*** (438 Rue du Parvis) which my wife's favorite since they’ve incorporated a cat into their brand and ***Korrigane*** (380 Rue Dorchester) which both offer tasting flights so you can sample a few flavors of their freshly made brews.

**NEARBY:**

Every time my family and I rode the bus it was on-time (more or less), very clean, and the operators were all polite. I also noticed that Quebec residents seem to not take the system for granted as most passengers were polite and respectful. Having frequented a bunch of bus systems in the States, that's definitely not always the case. If I had to quibble, I'd say the lack of a fare machine at Gare du Palais was a bit irritating considering the ticket desk for RTC wasn't well-labeled for tourists, and I wish there was an express bus to the airport. Overall though, the system is great for what it is and I'm very happy to have relied on it instead of paying through the nose for uber and lyft.",2025-08-10T07:33:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/1mmg8t1/shoutout_to_rtc/,
pd0ztg,You have a beautiful city with so many kind people! Just wanted to say merci!,,,86,1.0,19,"Bonjour!

I visited Quebec City this past week, and I had a wonderful time exploring your beautiful city!

Everyone was très gentil and didn't mind that mon français ne bien pas. The restaurants I went to had delicious food and servers who didn't mind my slow ordering en français.

Vieux Quebec is just as stunning as everyone told me it would be. I thought my expectations were too high due to how much people praised it, but nope, it was still completely awe-inspiring and even went above expectations.

The mountains, the St. Lawrence seaway, the Chateau Frontenac, the beautiful cobblestone streets with all the shops, the plentiful parks...it really did feel like stepping back in time and was so gorgeous. 

My only critique is that by the end of the third day, I was so over climbing hills and stairs! Even going down the steep hills takes concentration! However, it pays off with the amazing views, so it was worth it. (I didn't see many overweight people in Quebec City, and now I know why, haha).

Merci beaucoup to everyone who helped me with recommendations earlier this week and also for being so welcoming to English tourists and sharing your lovely city. I can't wait for my next trip back! I hope it will be cooler (it was 40+ degrees every day) and I also hope to speak only french next time. I'm slowly but surely getting better!

As a side note, immersion really is the way to go! In Gatineau or Montreal, people switch to English when they hear my accent. In Quebec City, people either couldn't speak English well or just stuck to French and it really helped me learn! I even started speaking more french without realizing it. So, thanks for that!

Take care!

P.S. My favourite breakfast was Buffet de L'Antiquaire and my favourite dinner was Chez Victor. But all were très bien!",2021-08-27T21:56:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/pd0ztg/you_have_a_beautiful_city_with_so_many_kind/,

1lqbtel,Our long weekend in Québec City - A Trip Report,figment1979,,70,0.97,33,"My wife and I spent a long weekend - Saturday to Tuesday - in Québec City and had a great time! Here's a brief summation of the things we did which might be helpful to others:

***Saturday June 28***

We drove from our home in Maine toward the US/Canada border at Sandy Bay/Saint-Théophile, drove north on Route 173, then north on A73 toward Québec City. We checked in to our hotel - the Clarion Pointe near the Airport, then got dinner at La Cage on Wilfrid-Hamel. The food was excellent and the servers were quite charming.

***Sunday June 29***

Sunday morning after breakfast, we drove to Montmorency Falls and followed the tip [~~here~~](https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/jlczef/free_parkingaccess_to_montmorency_falls/) *(****EDIT TO ADD - the tip at that link has since been removed - PM me and I can send it to you)*** to be able to get down to the falls for free! Even on a rainy day, the walk was not bad at all and the falls were stunningly beautiful.

We then drove out to Ile d'Orléans and drove around the island, stopping at a bunch of shops along the way. We also stopped a few times to admire the view, the scenery was just breathtaking!

One of the things we noticed on our drive around the island was the huge basilica in Beaupré, so after leaving the island, we drove a ways out 138 East to Beaupré to get a look at it in person. Such a stunning sight!

We enjoy mini golfing, so we went to the mini putt on Wilfrid-Hamel. Challenging course and we enjoyed the extra fun games in between each hole.

Dinner at St Hubert Rotisserie Chicken, which was excellent! I had their Bowl with the rotisserie chicken, my wife had their lobster roll, and both were quite tasty.

***Monday June 30***

On Monday we drove into the old city. At first, we wanted to park at the underground garage on Rue Dauphine, but my GPS was sending us the wrong direction and we couldn't find it until we ended up walking past it later 🤦🏼‍♂️. So we ended up parking WAY down the hill in the dirt lot on Rue Abraham Martin and walking up the hill to the old city. Next time we'll try to be much better prepared for this, not sure why the GPS was not helpful to us on this.

We greatly enjoyed browsing the shops along Rue Saint-Jean, and we did one of the free tours of the Parliament building. It was fascinating learning about Québec's system of representative government. I wish we had a similar one in the states!

We had a late lunch at St Patricks Pub and split a Beavertail (Queue de Castor), both were delicious. We've had Beavertails before in Toronto.

***Tuesday July 1***

Tuesday, we drove back to Maine, but we took route 277 on the way south for some different sights to look at. It was a bit of a scary drive at times in the pouring rain as it felt like I could hydroplane, but very scenic.

***Other thoughts***

* We are very, very thankful that so many people were willing and able to speak English. I know some French from taking classes in high school, but that was 30 years ago and I especially struggle with understanding what someone is saying when they speak French fastly. I felt awkward constantly asking for people to speak English, but very thankful they could.
* Québec City is a beautiful city, but the hills are very tiring, our feet were very sore on Monday night.
* The hotel was quite nice and included free breakfast, but the breakfast area was WAY too small for the number of people.

Overall we greatly enjoyed ourselves, thank you for your hospitality! Feel free to offer questions, suggestions, or comments.",2025-07-02T20:24:03,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/1lqbtel/our_long_weekend_in_québec_city_a_trip_report/,

14e3mws,Loved my first trip to Quebec City,RyanSongalia,,69,0.99,21,"I've been to Quebec before, having visited Montreal twice but this was my first time driving up to Quebec City from New Jersey - 8 hours northeast - and must say that I love the city. First thing that stuck out is the relative lack of traffic compared to Montreal. It seems like you can get anywhere in the city in 15 minutes, and parking is a lot easier to find than expected. I found the best poutine there at this place called Chez Gaston. I booked an Old Quebec Food Tour and a tour of the Morrin Centre, both of which taught me much about the food and history of the city. 

One thing I also appreciated is how understanding the people are of me, a guy from NJ with no handle on the French language. In Paris, I felt like people were annoyed with my lack of French, but people in Quebec City were much more patient with me, which makes me want to learn some French to use when I eventually return. Food there is great, though I'm sad Quebec City doesn't have an NHL team anymore. I will be back in the coming months for another trip to explore the rest of the city.

Having spent most of my time in Old Quebec, I'm hoping to do more things in the modern areas next time.",2023-06-20T02:57:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/14e3mws/loved_my_first_trip_to_quebec_city/,

1l9k1nn,Loved my visit - Merci!,timeinthemarket,,66,0.95,9,"Spent 4 days in QC recently and absolutely loved it. Spent the prior 4 days in Montreal and really liked QC more. 

The city is clean, beautiful in a lot of areas, has awesome food, seems affordable and the people are super nice.

Makes me want to learn French and move there. I did take some French in HS but it's been a while since I've used it. 

Stayed in old town near the bottom, did a walking tour of old town, went to Montmorency falls, Île d'Orléans, did a tour of the citadelle, and spent a few hours hiking in Jacques-Cartier National Park, ate a bunch of food and baked goods and just explored the city. 

Food wise at ate : 

Melba - amazing, would go again, one of the best meals I've had in a while. Wanted to try battuto after but couldn't get a table, will have to come back and try both in the future.

Taniere - made the reservation before they got their michelin stars, assume it's harder to book now. Quite good, excellent service, cool experience, non-alcoholic drink pairing was solid, food was unique(only ingredients from Quebec) although not mind blowing, worth doing once for the experience but given the price I'd probably opt for multiple dinners at Melba over this

Le Clan - $5 per plate lunch deal is amazing(same plates would be $12 USD per in my neck of the woods) and the food was pretty good(not great)

Lapin Saute - random old town pick given we got in late and didn't have a specific reservation, quite mediocre, got the rabbit poutine which was pretty good if you ignore the rabbit

Nacho Pub - another random old town pick after the walking tour, prior to going to the falls. Ok Poutine. 

Wanted to try a variety of other places like Buvette Scott and things of that ilk but beyond Melba/Taniere, didn't make specific reservations to try some, next time though. Was pretty worn out from eating out after 4 big meals in Montreal so stayed in a few times for food at home. Also didn't get to a real quality poutine place as far as I know. 

Looked at bakery recommendations here and tried 

La Chouquette - very good

Croquembouche - good

Pascal le boulanger - very mediocre

Back to costs, I know there's differences in salaries but northeast US is so much more expensive than what I could get here. 2.99 CAD for a really high quality croissant when a similar quality one where I live is $5 and there's 10 different bakeries that probably offer ones just as good, spoiled for choice. 

Roads seems safe(although we did hit some car part lying in the middle of the highway on the way out), everyone on the road seemed super easy going letting me merge without issues, everyone drives on the right outside of passing, all positives, a big difference from American drivers. 

Hopefully I didn't miss much but let me know what I have to do on my next visit. It's not the worst drive for me(7 hrs or so) so next time I'll likely just spend the whole week in QC and skip Montreal with a plan to visit as soon as next year. 

I know foreigners can't buy real estate in QC but I couldn't help but look around and things didn't seem crazy expensive, maybe it's time to start planning my future move somehow.",2025-06-12T07:27:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/1l9k1nn/loved_my_visit_merci/,

1o4dn2i,Wow! The food!,buckybiz,,59,0.98,4,"We were in Charlevoix and Quebec City this past week and can't believe the quality of the restaurants. 

Charlevoix 
Gentille Buvette. Not a missed step. Every course and every wine was gorgeous. The food, service and ambiance were all perfect. 

Ah La Vache. Take out fondue! Perfect and fun.

Quebec City 
jjacques. I will admit that I thought it would be too much experience and not enough cuisine, but I was wrong. Really great menu, super cocktails and very good wine by the glass. We sat at the bar and got to watch all the action of the chefs. Excellent service and a great playlist! The dessert was mind-blowing. 

Le Clan. Reco from our waiter at JJ. Had lunch here. $5 small shareable plates. We didnt love the desserts but everything else was delicious  and innovative (spaghetti with halibut chowder... I mean really... who does this and is able to make it so fun and interesting to eat??). 

Sinsemella. Wow what a surprise. I can't even describe the dishes because they were so complex and delicious and fun. We had the 3 course menu with wine pairing and each course and pairing was superb. Crazy stuff like vinegar made from spruce, cakes and meringue made from parsnip, and i can't even remember the rest. The restaurant is casual and relaxed and the food is perfect. Democratizing gastronomy. If only we lived closer... 

Beverages. Great local beer, cider and wine! The Quebec wine scene is really interesting and developing with some very good roses and chardonnay. The ciders, so different as compared to Ontario and France, are in a class of their own and truly shine. I'm not a beer drinker but my partner enjoyed some interesting local beers. 

We are already planning our return trip!

J'ai ensuite vécu à Montréal 5 ans, 5 ans à Québec, ensuite je suis reparti à Mtl 4 ans our m'installer définitivement à Québec depuis 6 ans.

J'ai vécu dans plusieurs quartiers à Mtl et Québec. Même brièvement sur les rives sud des deux villes.   Je considère aujourd'hui Québec comme ma ville.d'adoption après avoir déménagé autant.

J'ai vécu dans Montcalm, SJB longtemps, St-roch et maintenant le vieux Limoilou.   J'habiterais n'importe où dans ce quadrilatère.   

J'ai peine à imaginer une ville aussi plaisante à marcher.  Je me promène dans ces quartiers depuis des années en faisant un peu toujours les mêmes trajets et je suis toujours aussi ébahi de comment on est chanceux d'avoir des quartiers centres aussi agréables, parsemé de belles rues commercantes, de superbes parcs, d'architecture de tout genre et de gens un peu divers.  Je ne suis pas un grand fan du Vieux QC (trop kitch) mais ça reste agréable en saison morte.

La seule chose que je trouve difficile est d'endurer tout ces connards obscurantistes auditeurs de radio d'opinion où ne fait que parler de climato-anxieux et de woke et whatever.  

Je sais qu'il y a des réactionnaires stupides un peu partout, mais ici ces gens ont les entends au travail, dehors, dans les commerces, au resto...opiner (regurgiter) leur marde qu'ils ont appris dans leur petite ride de char vers leur banlieue dortoire 

On me dit que c'est une minorité mais J'ai fait beaucoup de consultation dans la plupart des ministères et du privé aussi et c'est au moins le quart ou le tiers du monde qui vomi ses opinions de radio au bureau.  Ajoutez à ça qu'ils sont des grandes gueules...ça finit qu'on entend que eux.


Personnellement, je trouve que c'est irritant majeur et je ne peux pas imaginer qu'un immigrant ou autre minorité puisse se sentir bien ici.  Déjà que le milieu du travail à Québec fonctionne par reseautage, on dirait vraiment une ville de rednecks.  Même le monde de ma minuscule ville de 10k personnes sonnent pas de meme.   

Des fois je synthonise radiox pour écouter et je me rassure en disant que la radio est un média mourant et que leur animateurs semblent de plus en plus pic-pics.   On dirait des nobody qui jasent autour d'une broue sauf qu'ils parlent à mes collègues qui sont dans leur char en route pour emmerder l'équipe au bureau.   

Bref, c'était mon petit chialage.   Et si vous entendez une grande gueule au bureau qui régurgite son petit caca de X...faites leur sentir que c'est de le temps de se la farmer🙊",2023-01-10T23:46:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/108vsk5/une_si_belle_ville_mais/,

rtl77d,Québec City - Real life Arendelle,TC19962022,,59,1.0,13,"I moved to Québec City in October 2021 and I say it is a real life Arendelle (*Frozen* fan here)

1. The old town is encircled with 4.6 km of walls.

2. Inside the old town there is a castle. Ok not really but there is the Chateau Frontenac, a hotel which looks like a castle. 

3. Like any 1800s kingdom, Québec has a fort - *La Citadelle de Québec* protecting it

4. While not on a fjord, Québec is a port city located on the Saint Lawrence River. 

5. The weather. Like Arendelle, Québec has mild summers and cold and snowy winters. It is the snowiest major city in North America.

6. The terrain. Québec is located on a plateau, and not too far away are the Laurentian Mountains. Covered with trees, these mountains are a site to behold, especially in the winter. And are quite reminiscent of Arendelle 

7. Québec contains North America's only Ice Hotel; an masterpiece of construction, design, and engineering, and can easily appear to be a monument to Elsa's ice palace.

8. Québec has North America's largest winter park, and is a city where outdoor winter activities are a key part of the culture. People here don't just tolerate winter; they celebrate it

As a whole, Québec in the winter with its frozen rivers, snowy wooded mountains, and its European style Old Town really does have an Arendelle style vibe to it.

And no, no one is paying me to write this but if I were Disney I would try to work out some *Frozen* licensing deals with the city.",2022-01-01T10:10:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/rtl77d/québec_city_real_life_arendelle/,

150gvjg,I love Quebec City!,jogyesakr,,54,0.96,21,"Bonjour r/quebeccity, 

Je viens de rentrer à Toronto après ma première visite dans votre belle ville et je pense que je suis amoureux. Je suis resté dans le Vieux-Québec et j'ai exploré principalement cette région à pied, mais je suis tombé amoureux non seulement de l'esthétique, mais aussi de la gentillesse des habitants. 

Ayant grandi à Toronto, j'ai toujours entendu dire que les Québécois sont grossiers et méchants avec quiconque essaie de parler anglais avec eux, mais j'ai trouvé que mon expérience était tout à fait le contraire. Je comprends que j'étais dans une partie touristique de la ville et que la plupart des gens avec qui j'ai interagi étaient dans l'industrie du tourisme, mais j'étais toujours amoureux de mon expérience et de mes interactions avec la population locale. 

Je me demandais si vous qui habitez à Québec trouvez la vie aussi difficile et aussi chère que dans le reste du Canada. Les habitants de Toronto par exemple sont généralement mécontents, stressés et ont du mal à vivre dans cette ville. 

J'ai suffisamment apprécié le Québec pour envisager peut-être d'y trouver du travail et de m'y réinstaller, mais je me demande aussi ce que les habitants pensent des autres Canadiens qui déménagent dans leur belle ville en raison du coût de la vie dans les grandes villes. Je déménagerais là-bas avec la ferme intention d'apprendre et de maîtriser la langue française et de m'intégrer à la culture locale.

Toutes les pensées sont appréciées! Merci d'avance et merci d'être une ville si hospitalière sur la base de mes quelques jours là-bas. Aussi, veuillez m'excuser si mon français ne semble pas naturel car j'ai écrit ceci en anglais, puis je l'ai traduit en français à l'aide de Google. Merci.

Hello r/quebeccity,

I just returned to Toronto after my first visit to your beautiful city and I think I am in love. I stayed in Old Quebec and explored mostly that area on foot but fell in love not only with the aesthetic but with how kind the local people were. 

Growing up in Toronto I always heard that people in Quebec are rude and unkind to anyone who tries speaking English with them but I found my experience to be quite the opposite. I understand that I was in a touristy part of town and that most people I interacted with were in the tourist industry but I was still enamoured with my experience and interactions with the local people. 

I was wondering if you people living in Quebec City find life to be as difficult and as expensive as in the rest of Canada. People in Toronto for example are generally unhappy, stressed and finding it difficult to live in this city. 

I enjoyed Quebec enough to consider perhaps finding work there and resettling but I also wonder what locals think of other Canadians moving to their beautiful city due to the cost of living in major cities. I would be moving there with the full intention of learning and mastering the French language and assimilating into the local culture. 

Any thoughts are appreciated! Thank you in advance and thank you for being such a hospitable city based on my few days there. Also, please forgive me if my French doesn't sound natural as I wrote this in English and then translated it to French using Google.

Thank you.",2023-07-15T12:51:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/150gvjg/i_love_quebec_city/,

Saw Montmorency Falls and took the trolley there - beautiful. Next La Nougaterie on the Ile, family business, fun and delicious - also fresh carame.  Then chocolate de Ile d’Orleans, fabulous shapes and gift option. Drove around the entire island…stopped at two wineries and one cider.  Great day, easy drive. Spent most of a day at the Strom spa with a massage and using the many hot pools including a small lazy river-excellent, might be adults only as I didn’t see children.

vffil1,Why is Québec's downtown so far behind other Canadian cities in terms of improving access to non-motorists?,Thirstymonster,,48,0.82,46,"I'm constantly appalled by the blatant disregard of pedestrians/cyclists inherent in the design of the roads downtown, and by the fact that the city seems unwilling to implement any useful or intelligent solutions. Walking and cycling in this city is often terrifying. Other cities seem to be in the process of correcting their flaws, by prioritizing pedestrians at intersections, limiting right on red, improving cycling infrastructure, etc.

Meanwhile in Québec, we have to wait several minutes in the cold to cross literally any road (after which motorists run the red lights anyway because they're invited to drive so fast on the wide ""arterial"" roads), if there's even a crosswalk available, which there often isn't. Not to mention putting uncontrolled ""crosswalks"" on literal highway on-ramps (what the fuck?). Most of the city's design shouts loud and clear that pedestrians and cyclists are not welcome here, and if you don't have a car you should fuck off. I realize this is a result of the automania of the postwar period, but seriously, it's 2022.

I often decide not to go to a store or restaurant that would be a couple of minutes away in theory, simply because it would involve waiting to cross a smelly loud intersection for an unacceptable amount of time. In terms of bike infrastructure, the city just paints lines and little bikes with arrows on roads that are physically unfit to bike on, and calls it progress. 

There are some simple and inexpensive solutions that could be immediately implemented to improve the situation, such as using leading pedestrian intervals / fixing the absurdly long light sequences, putting up barriers along the borders of bike lanes, and adding crosswalks at intersections that obviously need them. However, it seems to me that the city simply does not care. The most I've seen in Saint-Sauveur is a billboard on Aqueduc asking drivers to please respect the signalization, ironically placed right after an incredibly dangerous high speed intersection with a fake bike lane and no signalization to speak of. 

Obviously, there are also many other major problems that also need to be fixed, such as the RTC – which is highly unreliable and far too infrequent most of the time – reducing the widths of the inexplicably wide, dangerous and inefficient stroads (Charest, Marie de l'Incarnation, René-Levesque, Wilfrid-Hamel, Honoré-Mercier, etc etc), having sidewalks that don't flicker in and out of existence as you walk them, and limiting car access to commercial roads such as St-Jean, which is for some reason allowed to be treated as a miserable thoroughfare. 

What would it take to have these problems fixed? Innocent people get injured and die all the time on Charest and that doesn't seem to change anything. I've seen city reports and committee recommendations from many years ago outlining these problems and possible solutions, but it doesn't seem like the people in charge have tried to make any substantial progress. Compare this to other cities like Montreal, Paris and Toronto, which are taking both small and large steps to improve accessibility. These cities are big and complicated, but they're getting it done. What's our excuse? 

Sorry about the rant, I just hope I'm not the only one frustrated with this.",2022-06-18T17:13:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/quebeccity/comments/vffil1/why_is_québecs_downtown_so_far_behind_other/,

Ça fait quelques années que j’habite à Brossard, et la première chose que j’ai remarqué ici c’est qu’il y a un osti de problème de monde égoïste qui promène leur chien sans laisse. La semaine passée, une dame âgée d’une résidence s’est fait mordre par un petit chien sans laisse et a été emmené à l’hôpital par prévention. Cet été, je me suis fait approcher, lécher et suivre par des chiens sans laisse (alors que je suis très allergique et que si le chien me lèche le visage ou les mains je risque de devoir aller à l’hôpital). C’est rendu que ma blonde a même peur de faire son jogging parce que les chiens sans laisse pourraient l’attaquer. Je vois le monde utiliser les deux parcs à côté de chez moi comme parcs à chiens, alors qu’il y a clairement des signes qui disent PAS DE CHIENS. 

Ben oui ton chien il est cute, et il est tellement bien entrainé et il est tellement parfait. Mais un chien ça reste un animal qui peut avoir un comportement imprévisible, pas tout le monde aime les chiens, et y’a beaucoup de monde qui sont allergiques ou qui ont peur des chiens et qui ont pas envie de se faire tourner autour ou lécher par un animal qu’ils connaissent pas.

On a signalé admin - ils ont rien fait.
On ne peut pas appeler un remorquage car il n’y a pas de panneau Remorquage à votre frais.

What happens after I pay the fine?

l7fkkg,GameStop et WallStreetBets expliqué,TheFarnell,,2508,0.98,409,"*J'ai écrit ce billet pour le publier ailleurs, mais je me suis dit que ça pourrait en intéresser certains ici aussi à mieux comprendre ce qui se passe avec GameStop et WallStreetBets.  Ceci n'est pas un conseil financier ou juridique.*

Le prix d'une action de GameStop a sauté de plus que 1500% en cinq jours (et plus de 10,000% depuis six mois) et certains sont pris de panique.  Essayons de comprendre ce qui se passe.

\-- La vente à découvert --

D'abord, il faut comprendre un concept important: la vente à découvert (mieux connu sous son nom anglais: ""short sell"").

Une vente à découvert, c'est quand Alice emprunte de Bruno une pomme qu'elle vend immédiatement, tout en promettant à Bruno qu'elle lui retournera une pomme dans un mois.  Si Alice vend la pomme aujourd'hui pour 2$, et que dans un mois elle peut acheter une pomme pour 1.50$ pour la rendre à Bruno, Alice se fera un profit de 0.50$ (le prix qu'elle a eu pour vendre sa pomme moins le prix qu'elle paye pour la remplacer).  Comme ça, Alice se fait un profit si le prix des pommes baisse.  Mais si le prix de pommes monte à 3$, Alice perdra 1$ (elle aura vendu la pomme pour 2$ et devra en racheter une pour 3$).  Et le risque pour Alice est potentiellement infini - si le prix monte à 1000$, elle devra quand même payer 1000$ pour remplacer la pomme qu'elle a vendu pour 2$.  (Précisons ici qu'on présume que toutes les pommes sont les mêmes et que Bruno est indifférent qu'Alice lui rende sa pomme initiale ou une autre pomme.)

Dans les marchés boursiers, le principe est le même, mais au lieu de pommes, c'est des actions de compagnies, et au lieu d'Alice, c'est des gros fonds institutionnels qui parient des millions de dollars à la fois.  C'est une pratique très risquée, un peu controversée, mais totalement légale qui permet de se faire de l'argent quand les autres vont en perdre.

\-- La situation de GameStop --

On arrive donc à GameStop, un détaillant de jeux vidéos durement touché par le virement numérique et les fermetures de magasins pendant la pandémie.  Y'a quelques mois, plusieurs gros gestionnaires de fonds ont décidé que la valeur des actions de GameStop devait baisser, et se sont mis à vendre à découvert des actions de GameStop par milliers.  Le prix des actions de GameStop a en effet baissé (en partie parce que les ventes à découvert augmentent l'offre en vendant des actions qui n'ont pas été d'abord achetées, mais seulement empruntées), et les gros fonds ont senti une bonne affaire.  Ils se sont donc mis à vendre de plus en plus d'actions à découvert de cette façon.

\-- L'erreur des gros fonds --

Le problème, c'est que les gros fonds sont allés beaucoup trop loin, et collectivement, ils ont emprunté plus d'actions de GameStop que le nombre total d'actions en existence de la compagnie, en revendant à découvert les actions souvent empruntées de ceux à qui ils venaient de les vendre.  

C'est comme si Alice empruntait un pomme de Bruno pour la vendre à Charles, puis ensuite empruntait la même pomme de Charles pour la vendre à Élise.  Même si c'est la même pomme qu'elle à vendu trois fois, Alice devra éventuellement rendre à Bruno et Charles une pomme chaque.  Si il manque de pommes pour remplir toutes ses promesses, Alice sera en défaut de paiement.  Mais dans les marchés boursiers, être en défaut de paiement, c'est la pire chose possible, et ça mène généralement à la faillite.

Y'a donc certains gros fonds qui se trouvent à devoir bientôt retourner des actions de GameStop à ceux de qui ils les ont empruntées, et y'a potentiellement pas assez d'actions dans le marché pour remplir toutes leurs promesses.  (Cette situation s'appelle un ""short squeeze"" en anglais.)

\-- /r/WallStreetBets et le collectif d'investisseurs amateurs --

Y'a un petit groupe d'investisseurs amateurs (et on parle vraiment ici d'amateurs - des gens qui ont souvent juste quelques centaines de dollars d'économies en jeu) sur un forum internet de la plateforme Reddit, nommé WallStreetBets, qui ont réalisé que y'avait plus de ventes à découvert que y'a d'actions de GameStop (l'information est publique et facilement accessible, mais rarement analysée par des amateurs).  Ils ont donc vu une opportunité de ruiner les gros fonds d'investissement (qui ne sont pas très populaires sur WallStreetBets et en général) en achetant massivement des actions de GameStop et en refusant de les vendre.

Pour revenir à l'analogie d'Alice et ses pommes, imaginez qu'on arrive vite au point où Alice doit rendre une pomme à Bruno et Charles, mais que y'a très peu de pommes à vendre (peut-être parce qu'Alice n'est pas la seule à avoir vendu des pommes à découvert et devoir rendre des pommes à leurs prêteurs initiaux).  Alice ne serait peut-être pas capable de trouver quelqu'un pour lui vendre des pommes au prix qu'elle veut, mais elle DOIT rendre des pommes à Bruno et Charles.  Alice doit donc offrir d'acheter les pommes plus cher et plus cher encore jusqu'à ce qu'elle trouve quelqu'un prêt à lui vendre - dès maintenant - une pomme au prix qu'elle offre.  Et ça, peu importe la valeur d'une pomme la semaine passée ou la semaine prochaine.

Ce que les amateurs de WallStreetBets ont fait, c'est qu'ils ont décidé d'acheter le plus possible de pommes - les actions de GameStop - quelques jours avant que les gros fonds doivent le retourner à leurs prêteurs, et REFUSER de les vendre.  Le résultat, c'est que les quelques actions de GameStop toujours disponibles en vente libre explosent en prix à mesure que les gros fonds montent les enchères pour remplir leurs promesses de retourner les actions qu'ils ont empruntées y'a plusieurs mois.

\-- Où on en est --

La situation reste très fluide et pourrait changer d'heure en heure.

Déjà, quelques gros fonds ont fait faillite.  Plusieurs autres sont pris de panique.  Quelques plateformes de vente et d'achat d'actions, dont notamment Robinhood, une plateforme populaire chez les jeunes pour sa promesse de rendre accessible à tous les opérations à la bourse, ont notamment rendu impossible à leurs utilisateurs d'acheter d'autres actions de GameStop (mais toujours en permettre la vente).  Ils font probablement ça pour inciter leurs utilisateurs à vendre leurs actions de GameStop et en diminuer le prix, pour aider les gros fonds - dont plusieurs sont des partenaires commerciaux de Robinhood - à en acheter à des prix plus bas pour remplir les obligations des gros fonds et ainsi qu'ils évitent la faillite.

Y'a donc un élément important de lutte de classes à ce qui se passe.  D'un bord, un petit nombre de gros fonds d'investissement multimilliardaires qui se livrent à des spéculations risquées pour se faire des profits, et de l'autre, une grande masse de petits investisseurs amateurs qui se sentent délaissés par le système financier et qui ont trouvé une faiblesse exploitable dans les pratiques douteuses des gros fonds.  Les actions de Robinhood et d'autres plateformes similaires, qui se disent supposément du bord des petits investisseurs mais qui se montrent plutôt favorables aux gros fonds en temps de crise, n'aident pas les choses.  Certains petits investisseurs y voient une tentative par les gros joueurs de manipuler les marchés en leur faveur quand ils se font prendre à avoir été trop avares, et une enième preuve que le marché boursier et truqué contre eux.  

\-- Ce qui s'en vient --

Le prix des actions de GameStop reste très volatile et imprévisible.  Il perd la moitié de sa valeur en un instant et double en prix le prochain.  Des politiciens états-uniens des deux grands partis - et même des extrêmes des deux grands partis - appellent ensemble à ce que les plateformes comme Robinhood ré-ouvrent leur plateformes et cessent de manipuler les marchés, et font appel au régulateur des marchés boursiers états-unien - la SEC - d'intervenir pour mettre fin à la volatilité.

Impossible, pour l'instant, de savoir si les petits investisseurs ou les gros joueurs sortiront vainquants.  Il est entièrement possible que les deux soient perdants - et plusieurs sur WallStreetBets, frustrés par ce qu'ils voient comme les pratiques immorales du secteur financier, semblent surtout vouloir voir les gros fonds perdre coûte que coûte.

Chose certaine, les marchés boursiers en général passent un moment turbulent.  Afin de trouver l'argent nécessaire pour acheter les actions de GameStop aux prix démesurés actuels, plusieurs des gros fonds font des véritables ventes de feu de toutes leurs autres actions, ce qui déprime grandement la valeur de l'ensemble des actions du marché, même celles qui n'ont rien à voir avec GameStop.

Prenant un peu de recul, certains analystes croient que le marché boursier en général est dans une bulle, c'est-à-dire que les valeurs des actions sont sur-évaluées.  Si c'est le cas et que la situation ébranle assez la confiance des investisseurs (tant les gros que les petits), l'effet pourrait être une chute rapide et dramatique de la bourse.

Même avec ce long texte, je simplifie nécessairement une situation très complexe et encore en évolution.

***

Pas totalement relié, mais j’en profite pour plugger un petit clip sur les lois québécoises sur l’achat et la vente des actions hors de la bourse, si ça vous intéresse.

La cérémonie sera en fait pour devenir Canadien, mais au fond de mon cœur, c’est Québécois que je deviendrai.

Honnêtement, je n'ai aucun problème avec le reste du Canada. C'est pas mal. Mais à chaque fois que j'y vais, je ne me sens pas de la même façon qu'au Québec. Il y a quelque chose qui manque. La façon la plus simple de l'expliquer serait de dire que c'est uniquement au Québec que je me sens chez moi.

D'une certaine manière, c'est intéressant. Quand ma blonde et moi sommes arrivés ici, l'opinion courante des gens nous avait donné l'impression que le Canada était très ouvert, mais que le Québec serait un coin fermé si on ne parlait pas français parfaitement ou n'était pas ""pure laine"".

Ce n'était pas du tout le cas. Les Anglos n'ont jamais été hostiles envers nous, mais je trouve très difficile d'avoir une conversation qui ne soit pas superficielle avec eux. Je me sens un peu comme un poisson hors de l'eau la-bas.

Le Québec, au contraire, il a capturé mon cœur. J'aime la musique, l'amour pour la bonne bouffe, le sens de l'humour, le français que résonne dans la même fréquence qui mon portugais maternel, et franchement même l'hiver. Ceci est ma petite lettre d'amour au Québec. Je suis heureux de devenir citoyen de cette nation québécoise.

Merci, les Québécois! Je vous aime, mes chums!",2025-05-13T23:59:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quebec/comments/1km60uc/demain_je_vais_devenir_québécois/,

Fais-je davantage d'exercice physique, et ai-je pris du recul sur l'insignifiance de la vie salariale sous le capitalisme tardif, me direz-vous? Nan, je passe juste mes journées en pyjamas et je ne prends plus soin de mon apparence, incluant le développement d'une tignasse particulièrement léonine.

Mais la semaine passée, sentant les premiers remous d'une troisième vague prenant davantage les allures d'un tsunami, et confronté à la difficulté croissante de discipliner le monstre capillaire qui me tenait lieu de chevelure, ainsi qu'au regard mi-amusé, mi-horrifié de mes colocs, je décidai de me rendre chez le coiffeur avant que Legault ne nous enjoigne à un nouveau dernier effort**™.**

Je fus accueilli en anglais par une charmante coiffeuse, à qui je répondis bien évidemment en français afin de réaffirmer la primauté de notre belle langue sur celle de l'envahisseur, tokébakicitte, vous connaissez la toune.

Celle-ci tenta de m'expliquer dans un français maladroit qu'elle pourrait bien essayer de parler français, mais que cela lui serait bien difficile. De bonne grâce, et n'étant pas du genre à faire ma Karen outre mesure, j'étouffai mon désarroi et acceptai de me plier aux contraintes, mon anglais étant bien meilleur que son français.

Mais c'est alors que j'appris que la charmante coiffeuse était originaire de Londres, ici avec un permis de travail temporaire, et travaillant fort sur son français 4 matins par semaine dans l'espoir d'obtenir sa résidence, tandis que son chum québécois n'avait pas la patience de lui faire la jasette en français.

Je me dis que j'aurais vraiment été bête de faire un esclandre dans le salon de coiffure, et je fus satisfait d'avoir pris sur moi et décidé de passer outre l'affront initial. Pis j'me dis que son chum est un peu cave.

Faque c'est ça, je me suis fait servir en anglais, pis c'était pas grave.

Salut r/Quebec! Je m'appelle Gabriel Nadeau-Dubois, je suis porte-parole de Québec solidaire et député de la belle circonscription de Gouin (Rosemont/La Petite-Patrie à Montréal). Dans quelques minutes, je vais poser ma question du jour au premier ministre Legault. Après la période des questions, je vais remonter dans mon bureau et ça sera mon tour de répondre à vos questions. Je vais essayer d'en prendre le plus possible mais ça se peut que j'en échappe, ne m'en tenez pas rigueur!

À la lumière de l’article *« Assouplissement et aide d’urgence : Carney veut protéger les retraités des tarifs de Trump »*, une chose devient claire : les retraités qui ont pris des risques avec leurs placements seront protégés… mais les jeunes, eux, n’auront droit à rien.

Le S&P 500 a grimpé de 120 % en cinq ans. Aujourd’hui, il recule de 10 %, et déjà on parle de venir en aide aux aînés. Le Dowjones a monté de 90% depuis 2020.  

Et les jeunes, dans tout ça? Qu’est-ce qu’ils ont, eux?

Business trip payés quelques fois par années (surtout Toronto / New-York). Pas mal la job parfaite pour qqn qui aime grinder (et se faire micro-managed). Pas vrmt family-friendly. Used to be. Les dernières années étaient agréables mais les macro ont changés depuis 2022, donc l'entreprise aussi. Ce n'est plus pour moi. Out soon mais je voulais partager quand même.

Maintenant que la petite maison en région est payée avec un vieux char et >750k en savings (parti de 0 avant cet emploi - j'ai acheté un chalet au bon moment et revendu au bon moment - chance calculée, et 100% de mon income va en savings depuis \~2 ans). Je suis prêt à explorer autre chose. Mon rêve de ti-cul est accompli, moving on.

J'ai grandi pauvre, j'ai un DEC en science humaine pour lequel j'ai eu besoin de prêts & bourses. Leçon apprise: l'important, c'est pas combien tu gagnes, c'est ce que tu fais avec. Le cash a confirmé que ma priorité c'est pas le cash lui-même, juste d'en avoir assez. Avec ce salaire-là, j'aurais pu prendre les options faciles à court terme: grosse maison récente, char neuf ciré chaque semaine, garde-robe trendy. J'ai choisi différemment. Je prends plaisir à flâner au thrift et dénicher LE morceau, à entretenir et réparer ma vieille voiture, à être frugal quand rien m'y oblige. C'est pas de la privation, c'est une liberté que je cultive. Autre leçon apprise : les gens qui se disent intelligent ne le sont pas, sans exception. J'ai toujours eu le imposter syndrome. Si tu l'as toi aussi, t'es à la bonne place. Meaning t'es hors de ta zone de confort, go get it.

Je savais que, pour moi, le rythme imposé par cette job ne durerait qu'un temps. J'aime vivre tranquillement, pas à la course. Je suis content d'avoir utilisé ma job pour vivre mieux, plutôt que de me laisser utiliser par elle et me perdre dans la boucle quasi infinie du ""toujours plus"", la spirale de la rat race.

1ggeqmz,J'ai accompagné un membre de ma famille dans un RDV avec son conseiller financier ,guppsala,,285,0.98,77,"Bonjour a tous,

Je suis CPA et Pl. Fin sans vente de produits donc j'ai souvent des requêtes de mes proches pour les aider  avec des situations financières/comptables, surtout mes oncles/tantes qui n'ont pas d'enfants. 

Ma tante qui a plus de 70 ans s'est fait convoquée par son institution financière pour une mise  a jour financière. Je l'ai accompagné , elle ne comprend pas bien ces enjeux et éprouve de l'anxiété par rapport a ces rendez-vous. Je vais essayer de donner un compte rendu le plus neutre possible de ce rendez vous. 

Premièrement, nous avons rencontré en tout 2 personnes (conseiller et spécialiste en assurances) qui était très sympathique. Ils ont mentionné les 2 être payés a salaire et ne toucher aucune commission sur les produits vendus, ce que je doute fortement. C'est probablement une twist de dire qu'ils ont un salaire fixe et une partie de leur rémunération est liée a la performance globale. Ca m'étonne quand même qu'ils s'en servent officiellement comme argument, car c'est clair qu'ils ont des incitatifs a vendre le plus de produits possibles . 

Alors on a présenté un plan financier sur 17 ans a ma tante (elle n'avait pas demandé ca , mais bon on va dire que c'est un plus). Des pages de  fichiers Excel écrits assez petits. Ma tante ne comprend évidemment rien de tout ca,  c'est beaucoup trop d'informations a absorber.  On lui montre ensuite l'impôt qu'elle aura payé a son deces si elle ne change rien. Ca donne un montant X$. Ca assume aussi que son train de vie annuel présent reste le meme jusqu'a sa mort.  En ce moment elle est encore dans son propre appartement.  Elle retire le minimum legal a chaque année de son REER (FERR)  et le place en CELI (elle arrive a l'économiser et vivre sur ses pensions). 

  
Arrive ensuite le spécialiste en assurances. Sa proposition est de doubler le retrait annuel du REER et d'investir le tout dans une assurance vie permanente de plusieurs centaines de dollars par mois. De cette facon, l'impot au décès est réduit et un paiement non imposable de 25,000$ est fait au moment du décès. 

C'est un peu la que je suis flabbergasté. Ma tante ne connait rien donc elle aurait probablement signer les papiers. Mais cette proposition de produits ne tient pas compte des éléments suivants :

1) Elle n'a aucun objectif successoral (pas d'enfant). Donc l'impot au deces n'est pas son premier souci. 

2) Sa plus grande inquietude est le moment ou elle devra aller vivre en RPA a plus grand cout. C'est ce que le plan financier aurait du adresser et non pas l'impot au deces. Mais personne ne lui a demander. 

  
3) le retrait supplementaire du FERR lui faisait perdre son crédit TPS et solidarité, ce qui n'a pas été considéré (1400$/an en tout). 

  
4) j'ai demandé ensuite de modifier a l'ecran la dépenses mensuelles pour tenir compte d'un loyer RPA . PLus de 1500$ par mois apr rapport a son cout mensuel actuel. HE bin le plan change au complet, elle a besoin de tout ses placements pour financier ce cout et ne peut pas se permettre d'Acheter   d'assurance. 

  
5)  Mais quel est le processus interne de l'institution  pour en arriver la? Faire un plan sans trop parler au client et lui offrir un produit X basé sur des objectifs qu'elle n'a pas?

Tout au long du meeting ils ont rappelé que ce service est totalement gratuit. Ma tante a plusieurs centaines de millers dollar en placement garantis liés au marché (elle les a depuis tres longtemps,  elle ne m,a jamais demandé de conseils sur ses placements). Je me suis retenu de lui dire que ce type de placement est un des pires coté frais/risque/rendement.  Nulle part dans le meeting a-t-on adressé les frais de ses placements. 

  
Ca doit etre assez impressionnant le nombre de personnes qui tombent dans ce genre de suggestions.  Je dois dire qu'il n'y a pas eu de pression supplémentaire de vente quand on a mentionné ne pas etre intéressé.

Petit contexte:

* Homme (moi)
* 26 ans
* Cote de crédit 832
* Aucune dette (Sauf l'hypothèque qui arrive en juillet)
* \+ Ma conjointe 23 ans, même situation.



Je me suis dit que j’allais y déposer nos vrais chiffres et notre budget pour la maison. Peut-être que ça peut inspirer les premiers acheteurs, sachant que nous avons un salaire bien modeste !

On a trouvé une perle rare sous la barre des 400 000 $, à 15 minutes de la ville : grande cour arrière, toiture neuve, garage ! Nous sommes très contents de notre trouvaille. Le rapport d'inspection confirme que tous les travaux importants et coûteux ont été fait recemment !

***(Surenchère : il y avait 12 offres contre nous !)***

Pour les 💏 : ça veut dire que j’ai déjà divisé le montant par deux, puisque c’est ma feuille personnelle de budget. Ma conjointe paie donc aussi le même montant.



Et oui ! Même après toutes mes dépenses payées, entretiens de la maison inclut, **il me reste $1 255,16 à chaque mois** pour investir dans ma retraite et me nos loisirs !

J'ai 43 ans, j'ai commencé à investir il y a trois ans seulement, avant ça, toute ma vie j'ai été quelqu'un qui suivait son budget, pas de dettes, mais qui dépensait toutes ses paies... Quand j'avais 2 ou 3,000$ de côté, pour moi c'était un gros montant.

L'investissement en bourse a toujours été quelque chose qui m'intéressait, mais je trouvais que ca avait l'air compliqué, risqué et inaccessible. Mais quand j'ai découvert le site WealthSimple, ca tout changé.

Alors j'ai commencé à investir avec WealthSimple en novembre 2020, durant la pandémie. Au début j'investissais 50$ par ci, 100$ par là... Je lisais le site MotleyFool et j'investissais dans toutes sortes de patantes que je comprenais pas.

Est venu la folie GameStop et WallStreetBet... Je suis tombé dans le panneau et j'ai investis dans Blackberry! C'était au début 2021, j'ai été pris de fomo comme plusieurs et j'ai tout mis l'argent de disponible que j'avais sur $BB ... puis le stock a crashé en l'espace de quelques heures... j'ai vendu en panique... j'ai perdu genre 4,000$

Le reste de l'année 2021, j'ai continuer à investir dans plein de compagnies, vendre à perte... j'ai fait plein d'erreurs. Mais j'ai quand même terminé l'année avec 25,246$ d'investissements.

En 2022, j'ai commencé à lire plus, poser plus de questions sur des forums plus sérieux. J'ai continuer à faire plusieurs erreurs, mais j'ai aussi commencé à devenir plus informé et j'ai commencé à bâtir un portfolio plus solide avec des ETF qui reproduisent les index S&P500, Nasdaq et TSX... mais je continuais en parallèle à investir dans toutes sortes de compagnies...

Vers le milieu de 2022, c'est là que je suis devenu beaucoup plus sérieux et que j'ai lâcher les compagnies individuels et je me suis mis à me concentrer sur les ETF $VFV $HXT et $HXQ. J'ai terminé l'année avec 50,481$

2023 a été l'année où j'ai été le plus sérieux, mon portfolio était composé de $VFV, $HXQ, $ATD, $SOFI et des crypto, ETH et BTC. J'avais commencé à investir dans ces crypto ainsi que $ATD depuis 2020-21. J'ai terminé l'année avec 101,783$

Je gagne 80,000$ par année et je réussis à investir 35% de ma paie chaque 2 semaines. Mon loyer me coûte 1,200$ par mois. Mon épicerie me coûte 160$ par semaine. Pas d'enfants. Char payé depuis plusieurs années.

J'ai utilisé une marge de crédit à quelques reprises durant mes trois premières années d'investissement, pour ""average down"" certains stock.

Mes trois premières année d'investissement m'ont coûté exactement 16,000$ ... j'ai perdu 16,000$ en investissant dans des mardes et en vendant à perte.. J'ai énormément appris disons, 16,000$ est le pris que j'aurai payé pour apprendre à être sérieux en bourse. Mais aujourd'hui, mes choses vont bien, je suis ""le plan"", je continue d'investir seulement dans $VFV, $HXQ, $SOFI, $ATD et $BTC. En ce moment j'en suis à 116,000$ déjà.

1bwsvg0,Les résultats du sondage,AffairesDePiasses,,156,0.99,152,"Bonjour à tous !

Tout d’abord, je tiens à m’excuser pour le retard dans la publication de ces résultats, ayant été pas mal pris professionnellement et personnellement dans les dernières semaines. Mais mieux vaut tard que jamais, les voici les voilà, les résultats du sondage de r/QuebecFinance !

Avant de plonger dans le vif du sujet, et suite à de nombreuses remarques, un petit point méthodologie :

>Afin de préparer ce sondage et d’analyser les résultats, nous avons employé une approche rigoureuse, en utilisant une analyse factorielle de correspondances multiples pour assurer la représentativité des données, couplée à une régression logistique multinomiale et un échantillonnage stratifié proportionnel pour optimiser la validité externe et la fiabilité des résultats, tout en appliquant des tests de Chi-deux pour l'inférence statistique et une validation croisée pour minimiser les biais. Pour quantifier la précision de notre étude, nous avons établi une marge d’erreur de 3,14159% 6 fois sur 3 les années bissextile, en appliquant des techniques avancées de bootstrapping pour estimer la variabilité et en utilisant une méthode de Monte-Carlo pour simuler des distributions, ce qui assure une estimation robuste du taux d'erreur et confirme la solidité méthodologique et la validité de notre recherche.

Bref, on ne sait absolument pas ce qu'on fait, on fait ça pour le fun, j'ai juste copier/coller de phrases qui paraissent intelligentes 😜

Concernant les données : je tiens à remercier les quelques uns d’entre vous qui se sont complètement lâchés en nous mettant des valeurs farfelues, nous obligeant ainsi à passer en revue les lignes une à une, on ne savait justement pas quoi faire de nos soirées et de nos fins de semaine. Oui, vous êtes des winners ! 🏆

On a donc exclues les données les plus folles et corrigé le format de certaines informations.

1h3ppgm,Ma vie 2 ans apres une proposition,Fit-Negotiation-785,,133,0.93,48,"Salut à tous,

Je voulais partager mon expérience avec la proposition de consommateur pour aider ceux qui sont dans la même situation.

J’ai 26 ans, et il y a deux ans, à 24 ans, j’ai décidé de faire une proposition. Pour vous donner une idée, je viens d’une famille très modeste, et dès la fin de mon secondaire, je suis entré dans la construction. Avec un salaire de 80 000 $ par an et des paies de 900 $ par semaine, on pourrait croire que tout allait bien… mais j’étais toujours cassé.

Voici les dettes que j’avais à ce moment-là :
	•	BMO Mastercard : 18 000 $
	•	Desjardins : 8 000 $
	•	Prêt étudiant : 13 600 $ (je n’avais pas travaillé pendant 2 ans pour terminer mon DEP)
	•	Prêt auto : 10 000 $
	•	Prêt personnel : 10 000 $

Total : 59 600 $

En décembre 2022, j’ai opté pour une proposition au consommateur de 17 000 $ pour regrouper toutes ces dettes. J’ai aussi rendu ma voiture dans le cadre de la proposition, ce qui m’a permis de réduire mes frais. Heureusement, j’ai eu la chance d’habiter chez ma mère, donc pas de loyer à payer, ce qui m’a grandement aidé.

Où j’en suis aujourd’hui

Nous sommes maintenant en 2024-2025, et je suis fier de dire que j’ai traversé cette période difficile. J’avais beaucoup honte au début, mais j’ai payé ma proposition en seulement 6 mois. Aujourd’hui, je me sens libre et, paradoxalement, plus riche qu’avant, malgré un crédit qui est passé de 720 à 590.

Mon objectif est d’acheter une maison dans 2-3 ans. J’ai pu économiser 20 000 $, que j’ai placés dans mes REER et mon CELIAPP.

Mes conseils pour ceux qui envisagent une proposition de consommateur :

	1.	Payer la proposition rapidement. Mon conseil : terminez en 1 an, ou 2 maximum. Plus vite c’est fini, mieux c’est pour votre crédit et votre tranquillité d’esprit.
	2.	Utilisez des outils pour reconstruire votre crédit.
	•	Ouvrez une carte Capital One sécurisée.
	•	Essayez le programme de prêt sécurisé avec Koho (ça m’a beaucoup aidé).
	3.	Ne perdez pas espoir. Au début, j’avais l’impression de toucher le fond, mais aujourd’hui, je me sens beaucoup mieux. La proposition est une solution temporaire qui peut vraiment vous aider à reprendre le contrôle de votre vie financière.

Je suis fier de dire que j’ai fait ma proposition, que je l’ai terminée, et que je suis maintenant en meilleure position qu’il y a deux ans. À ceux qui sont dans cette situation : accrochez-vous. Vous pouvez vous relever, vous aussi.

Avec l’histoire des presque 50 % de Québécois à 200 $ de manquer un paiement, ça en fait du monde.

Pourtant, quand je me promène, je vois plus souvent des chars de l’année que de vieux modèles.

Ceci étant dit, on peut bien blâmer l’économie et nos dirigeants, mais dans mon livre à moi, ces gens-là se sont progressivement mis dans cette position à force d’une succession de petits choix… ou par manque d’ajustements quand la malchance frappe.

Ce chiffre-là est pire qu’il en a l’air, parce que ça veut dire que 50 % des Québécois, voire plus, ont une mauvaise gestion de leurs finances. Pis là, c’est un gros détail, mais si en plus de ce 200 $ ils n’ont rien mis de côté ou ne cotisent pas à leur retraite, ça va faire pas mal de monde à faire vivre plus tard avec des pensions…

Faudrait faire de la pub pour ce subreddit OPC, pour ces gens-là.

J'ai atteint 100k récemment à l'âge de 34 ans  et je n'ai personne avec qui partager cette bonne nouvelle.

 Mais surtout, je voulais savoir est ce que ce niveau d'épargne est considéré bon à mon âge sachant que je ne possède pas de maison/condo.

J'ai commencé tard ( manqué d'éducation) et certains événements comme le divorce ont ralenti mon taux d'épargne.

Quand j'ai atteint ce chiffre là, j'étais trés heureuse, mais après quelque réflexion, je me demande est ce que ce chiffre est vraiment bon en 2025. 100k , c'est la seulement la mise de fond pr le prix d'une maison moyenne à 500k. Alors je me sens un peu découragé 

C'est sure, que 100k investi en bourse pendant au moins 25 ans avec un rendement entre 7% et 10%, me permettra de prendre une retraite.

Il a appelé le numéro pour investir. Déjà là, je savais que c'était mal parti.

Il m'a montré le site Cinpax et m'a expliqué comment ça fonctionne. En gros, il transfère de l'argent sur Kraken, achète des bitcoins, et la personne au téléphone prend le contrôle de l'ordinateur pour transférer les bitcoins dans son portefeuille personnel sur Cinpax et Cinpax transfère ca en USD et achète des actions.

Ensuite, la personne au téléphone investit dans des choses étranges qui rapportent soit ~25%, soit ~-10%, comme l'USD-EUR, le pétrole, APPL, etc.

Je lui ai dit d'arrêter tout ça parce que c'est une arnaque. Je lui ai même montré des articles de La Presse et d'autres sources pour lui prouver que c'était un scam. Il m'a répondu que c'était correct et qu'il allait arrêter. À ce moment-là, il avait déjà investi environ 2000$. J'avais essayé de retirer l'argent, mais cela nécessitait un accès de type VIP, ou quelque chose du type.

Quelques semaines plus tard, j'ai appris qu'il avait remis environ 4000$ là-dedans. Sa justification était qu'il gagnait beaucoup d'argent et que le gars au téléphone était gentil. J'ai un peu perdu patience en essayant de lui montrer les vrais chiffres de ce qu'il avait investi, et il m'a dit qu'il n'allait plus en remettre. J'ai même réussi à lui faire transférer un REER d'une autre institution financière à Wealthsimple pour qu'il ait plus de contrôle. Je lui ai demandé de dire à la personne au téléphone de retirer son argent, mais par hasard, c'était difficile et il ne pouvait retirer qu'une petite partie du montant. J'ai aussi appris qu'une connaissance éloignée s'était fait avoir pour 70k$ avec Cinpax et avait tout perdu. Mais mon père ne voit pas ça comme un *red flag*, pas du tout! Pour lui c'est différent.

Cette semaine, il m'a dit qu'il venait d'ajouter un autre 6000$ là-dedans... Je ne sais plus quoi faire, il va se faire vider, et il n'a pas une grosse retraite. Je pensais prendre son téléphone et bloquer les numéros, mais les arnaqueurs changent sûrement de numéro comme ils veulent.",2024-08-18T15:55:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/comments/1evia3a/mon_père_retraité_se_fait_arnaquer_son_argent_de/,

En attendant de recevoir encore des réponses, voici déjà quelques informations :

• L'âge moyen du sub est de 32 ans, et l'âge médian de 31 ans. u/zerok37 ne doit plus se sentir tout jeune d'un coup.

• Nous comptons parmi nous 19% de femmes et 1% de non-binaires.

• Le revenu moyen individuel est de 107k/an, et le médian de 90k/an. En familial, les chiffres sont respectivement de 159k et 140k, mais étant donné qu'on a complètement oublié de demander qui est seul/en couple, ça ne sera pas nécessairement significatif.

• Les revenus individuels vont de $0 à $1M/an, et les valeurs nettes de -78k à 9M. En familial, c'est respectivement de $6k à $1.15M/an, et les valeurs nettes de -78k à 9.5M.

• Et juste pour le fun : oui, certains d'entre vous ont la fille de l'UQAM comme modèle financier et envisagent de vendre des photos de leurs pieds en cas de coup dur (u/herupandir vous attend en MP)

1lvkx1e,Est-ce que les fonctionnaires réalisent la valeur de leur retraite?,Realistic-Shine8205,,107,0.86,232,"Allo groupe, 

Je suis travailleur autonome, plutôt économe et chiche. Ça fatigue un peu (pas tant quand même) ma conjointe. Qui elle, travaille pour la fonction publique québécoise. Je lui rappel à l'occasion que je dois me bâtir ma retraite moi-même, en mettant des sous de côté. Elle trouve quand même que je fais beaucoup de compromis et sacrifices. Pour le plaisir dernièrement, j'ai calculé combien j'estimais le montant, où l'équivalent, que ma conjointe aurait dans un compte en banque lors de sa retraite à 60 ans. 

Avec l'aide de SimulR et d'une calculatrice de décaissement, j'arrive à un montant de tout près de 2 millions. C'est ce que ma conjointe aurait dans un compte à 60 ans (en 2045) pour obtenir l'équivalent des prestations que RREGOP lui versera de 60 à 90 ans.

Je lui explique c'est donc le montant que je dois moi même de coté...

Ma question aujourd'hui, selon votre expérience, dans votre entourage ou chez vos connaissances. Est-ce que vous trouvez que les fonctionnaires réalisent la valeur de leur fond de retraite? 

PS : Ma blonde est dans la fourchette assez haute des salaires dans la fonction publique, tous les fonctionnaires n'auront pas l'équivalent de 2 millions dans un compte à la retraite.

1libisb,Tactique illégale de négociation d'un agent immobilier?,bobbredd,,108,0.96,78,"Un agent représentant des vendeurs y est allé d'une drôle de tactique. Avec toutes les histoires de promesse d'achat bidon au QC, j'aimerais avoir votre opinion sur ce move:
Je visite avec ma conjointe une maison que nous aimons. L'agent nous renseigne qu'il a reçu une offre d'achat et donc qu'il faudrait se décider rapidement si nous sommes intéressés.
Nous envoyons une offre le lendemain pour 30K $ en dessous du prix demandé. Un peu plus tard, l'agent des vendeurs appelle notre agent et dit: "" les proprios ont aimé votre profil, et voudraient vous laisser la chance d'accoter l'autre offre. Si vous refusez, ils prendront l'autre offre"" et nous envoie une contre-offre au prix demandé, valide jusqu'au lendemain matin.
Après avoir réfléchi toute la nuit, nous décidons, le coeur un peu gros, de refuser la contre-offre, et donc dans notre tête de renoncer à la maison. Un peu plus tard l'agent nous envoie une autre contre-offre au prix que nous avions demandé, que nous acceptons.
Clairement, ils n'avaient pas vraiment l'intention d'accepter l'autre offre, et nous ont fait accroire cette idée pour aller chercher plus d'argent. Tactique illégale? Sournoise, mais dans les règles? J'aimerais vous entendre!

EDIT : Petite précision. Je ne remets pas en doute l'existence de l'autre offre ici. Ou le fait de précipiter les choses. Je me questionne sur l'ultimatum qu'ils m'ont proposé, qui semble être mensonger.

1m1upmj,Expérience d'un débutant après 4 ans,L_Q_C,,106,0.9,50,"Salut QuebecFinance,

Je voulais partager mon expérience après 4 ans d'un investisseur débutant... Si ça peut servir à quelqu'un d'autre et éviter quelques erreurs !

Et oui, mon portfolio a un maigre 6% de rendement au total sur 4 ans... Soit moins de 2% par an. Pour expliquer ça, il faut comprendre un peu mon ""épopée"". À noter que ce compte ne comporte qu'un partie de l'ensemble de mes placements. Malgré tout ce parcour, je suis vraiment fier de renouer avec le vert!


Chapitre 1 : la naïveté 
Je m'inscrit à Wealthsimple à l'été 2021. Ayant un peu d'argent de lousse, je me dis que je pourrais peut être gérer une partie de mes fonds moi même. Mon intérêt à l'époque est surtout porté sur les énergies renouvelables, les voitures électriques et les crypto monnaie. J'investi donc quelques milliers sur 1 an dans des compagnies locales, comme Boralex, Innergex, Taïga, Lion, quelques internationales comme Tesla et Aurora et en Etherum et quelques autres Cryptos. Un beau portfolio comme vous pouvez le constater. (LOL)

Apres 1 an et demi, mon portefeuille est dans le rouge assez solidement. Mes choix initiaux s'avèrent de plus en plus perdant...et je perd l'intérêt. Il faut comprendre que ma littératie financière de l'époque est très faible! 


Chapitre 2: le désert 
Avec des résultats assez désastreux, je ne suis plus très actif sur mon compte. Je fais un dépôt de temps en temps pour réinvestir et baisser mon coût moyen sur mes actions perdantes, que je ne vend pas. Je me dis que ça peut difficilement baisser plus et que ça va remonter... Mon portfolio se compare à une terre brûlée à la fin 2023 : -40%


Chapitre 3: la résolution 
Résolution du début d'année 2024: me bâtir un fond de retraite digne de ce nom. Je m'informe sur le sujet et ""découvre"" les FNB, la force des dépôts et achats récurrents, etc. Reddit m'aide beaucoup, ainsi que plusieurs références comme Nicolas Bérubé. A partir de ce moment j'applique ces conseils, tout en gardant une petite touche personnelle dans mes investissements. J'achète des FNB (VFV, ZGRO, XEQT), réoriente l'achat d'actions vers l'aérospatial et la technologie (RKLB, LUNR, NVDA), priorise le Bitcoin avec de petits achats quotidien à la place des autres crypto inutiles.
Mon portfolio grossit à vu d'œil. Oui j'ai augmenté considérablement mes investissements réguliers, mais en plus mes placements font enfin du rendement, wow !

Je fais toutefois l'erreur de ne pas vendre mes actions perdantes... Jusqu'à leur faillite dans le cas de Lion et Taïga. Ouch.


Mes apprentissages à ce jour:
- Quand tu passe par une phase prolongée de perte à plus de 40%, plus rien ne te fais peur.
- C'est bien beau d'avoir des ""mains de diamant"", mais quand un titre est sur le respirateur artificiel... Il faut couper le cordon.
- Bien que j'ai du plaisir à miser sur certains titres, c'est tellement plus simple d'investir dans les FNB... J'aurais tellement aimer connaître ça avant !!
- Les dépôts et achats récurrents est vraiment la meilleure stratégie. Cela m'a permis d'investir même dans des périodes d'incertitudes extrêmes.
- La pause de 2 ans dans mon compte m'a coûte très cher. Investir dans des FNB alors que la bourse était plus basse durant cette période aurait été tellement plus logique !
- Les crypto ça peut sembler bien cool, mais le BTC est vraiment la seule option viable, et encore. Je garde un maximum de 5-10% de mes investissements totaux en crypto.
- Investir dans les crypto, ça forge le caractère d'investissement en maudit!

Je pense maintenant être sur la bonne voie, ou du moins, en bonne partie !

Je trouverais ça égoïste de mettre au monde un enfant seulement pour combler un besoin maternel ou parce que je veux pas vieillir tout seul. 
Ce sera eux qui seront «pogné» pour survivre comme on essaie de le faire présentement. 

Et je comprends qu’un enfant n’est pas supposé avoir tout cuit dans le bec. Mais moi mes parents n’avaient pas les moyens d’avoir d’enfant et aujourd’hui je struggle. Je survie. Les loyers sont exorbitants. L’épicerie aussi. Meme avec notre salaires combinés a 120k

w1eq1t,Votre devoir de la semaine : réviser vos services qui facturent mensuellement,Gy7479,Budget,102,0.98,64,"Bonjour à tous! Ceci est un petit rappel en ces temps inflationnistes de réviser tous les services qui vous facturent mensuellement pour les optimiser et réduire vos factures. Avec bonus des conseils de vie en bas. Voici la liste

Votre banque : arrêtez de payer des frais mensuels sur votre compte chèque sauf si vous gardez une somme de plusieurs milliers de $, Tangerine c'est gratuit et c'est les meilleurs % d'intérêts (2,8-3,0%) sur le compte à intérêt ""élevés"". Je sais c'est chiant, mais ouvrez vous une ptite frette et vous aurez fini de transférer vos factures le temps de la finir et d'imprimer un spécimen de chèque pour les RH à la job pour la paye. PS: Equitable Bank arrive cet automne au Québec.

Cellulaire : allez sur Fizz (filiale de Vidéotron), faites le forfait qui vous convient et regardez chez les autres fournisseurs s'ils peuvent le battre. 

Internet : Même chose que cellulaire, faite votre forfait et essayer de le battre chez un compétiteur. Teksavy, Ebox, etc, n'oubliez pas les indépendants (je sais je sais, Bell a acheté Ebox, mais on jase de $ là). 

Assurances habitation/voiture : Quoi, LaCapitale veux faire passer mon combo de 175$ à 220$ par mois alors que j'ai jamais rien réclamé et que ça fait 6 ans que je suis avec eux? Fuck-e you. Après avoir fait plusieurs soumissions (maudits retour d'appels pendant 48h), Desjardins offre 167$ pour les mêmes conditions. Oh yeah!

Cartes de crédit : avez-vous vraiment besoin de celle qui vous charge 50$ par année pour presque pas d'avantages? Même la Costco? Pis les points sont pas si cool. À mort les points (*sauf exception), le cash est roi en ces temps troubles  C'est pas compliqué : carte de crédit remises en argent de Tangerine, gratuite et 3 catégories à 2% de remises. Et une autre soit la Scotia Momentum infinite (120$ annuel, gratuit première année), 4% remise cash sur épicerie et factures récurrentes, 2% essence, 1% le reste ; soit la BMO cashback world elite (120$, gratuit première année), 5% remise cash sur épicerie, 4% transport en commun, 3% essence, 2% factures récurrentes, 1% le reste. IMPORTANT : passer par le site creditcardgenius pour avoir une référence jusqu'à 100$ paypal + 10% de remise cash sur les premiers 2000$ facturés (environ).

Services de musique et streaming : En as-tu vraiment besoin? Splitter avec de la famille?

Assurance vie: si t'es marié, ou t'as des enfants ou une maison avec un/une partenaire, quessé t'attends! Do it! C'est genre 35$/mois pour un terme de 20 ans pour 500 000$. Touche pas à la police à vie, tu traînes sur QuebecFinance dans 20 ans t'es supposé avoir plus d'actifs que de dettes.

Épicerie : inscrit toi aux points Optimum, ça vaut la peine.

IMPORTANT: Pour les services de cellulaire/internet/banque: ya des belles primes de références tant pour le référé que celui qui réfère, utilise les si tu as des amis ou de la famille déjà avec eux.

Conseils de vie gratuits :
1: Pogne toi Office 365 Familial de Microsoft, partage la facture avec amis et famille pour avoir la suite Office à jour. Ça vient avec 1000 Go de stockage sur Onedrive. Fait un backup de ton ordi maintenant!
2: Avec ton super cellulaire à 1000$ (coupable...), prends des photos de chacunes des pièces de ta maison et du contenus de chaque pièce en détail (livres, bijoux, numéro de série de la TV et appareil photo, Playstation, Ordinateur, tout l'équipement de cuisine, etc). Crée un dossier Assurance maison, crée des sous-dossiers par pièces, mets les photos, copie ça sur Onedrive dans le Cloud. Si tu passes au feu ou te fais voler, tu vas remercier le ciel et tes assurances vont te bénir.

1nhfm1d,La retraite à 40 ans : Comment ont-ils fait?,Latter-Average-5682,,104,0.94,96,"J'ai emprunté ""Elle investit"" en version numérique parce que j'ai vu que ce livre revient souvent dans ceux les plus appréciés, alors je le conseille, mais sans même l'avoir lu (parce que je n'ai pas besoin de ce type de livre à ce point-ci de ma vie). Donc, je me suis dit que je l'emprunterais au moins pour le feuilleter rapidement; ce que j'ai fait. J'ai passé rapidement à travers le livre en une heure.

Je crois que c'est un bon livre.

Mais j'ai accroché sur une section : Les entrevues avec les gens qui ont pris une retraite jeune.

J'ai accroché parce que je conseille ce livre à des gens qui ont très peu des compétences financières, mais surtout qui ont de faibles revenus.

Et je trouve que ces types de livres ont toujours une section assez déconnectée qui relève de la fiction pour la majorité des gens. Et je trouve que ça devient insultant.

D'ailleurs, une personne a récemment partagé dans ce sub une vidéo qui traitait de l'effet des différents aléas de la vie qui impactent négativement les finances du commun des mortels, bref le travailleur moyen, et c'est tellement vrai que la croissance de notre valeur nette ne suit généralement pas une belle courbe de rendement composé.

Je regarde les maths derrière ces histoires de retraite hâtive et il y a toujours quelque chose qui cloche, et une présentation exagérée.

Le premier cas : Andrew Hallam. Ça dit qu'il est devenu millionnaire à 36 ans en tant que professeur au secondaire. Et là on embellit l'histoire en disant qu'il a commencé à investir à 19 ans seulement 100$/mois. Puis, il est devenu professeur à 26 ans avec un salaire net de 28k$ où il arrivait à investir 8400$/an. Bon, faisons un peu de maths. Sa vraie carrière a commencé à 26 ans et il a donc pris sa retraite seulement 10 ans plus tard. Assumons que de ses 19 ans à ses 26 ans, il a progressivement augmenté son épargne de 100$/mois à 700$/mois. On va simplifier et dire qu'il a augmenté son épargne de 25% par année durant cette période. Et on va lui donner un méchant bon rendement de 15%/an. Donc, à 26 ans, il avait peut-être 27k$, arrondissons à 30k$ pour être généreux.

Maintenant, il reste 10 ans pour passer de 30k$ à 1M$ et on sait que son point de départ c'est 8400$/an. On va être encore plus généreux et dire qu'il a eu un méga rendement de 20%/an durant ces 10 prochaines années. On va dire qu'il a continué d'augmenter son épargne de 25%/an, donc après 10 ans c'était rendu qu'il épargnait 78k$/an selon cette hypothèse. On va considérer que c'est possible même pour un enseignant au secondaire parce qu'il a dit que vers la fin de sa carrière il est allé enseigner dans une école privée à Singapour où son logement était payé. Ben même en commençant avec 30k$ à 26 ans, avec 8400$/an d'épargne qu'il augmente de 25%/an, avec un rendement de 20%/an sur ses investissements pendant 10 ans, on arrive à peine à plus ou moins 800k$. Donc, comment a-t-il atteint 1M$ aussi rapidement? L'histoire ne nous donne pas toute l'info. Probablement des revenus complémentaires comme son blog, ses livres, mais sûrement plus que ça, parce que j'ai dû faire un cas exagérément idéalisé et je ne suis même pas arrivé à 1M$ malgré tout.

Bon ok... Alors allons au deuxième cas : Retraite 101. Il a commencé à investir à 25 ans et il a atteint son montant magique de 750k$ à 35 ans. Son salaire initial était de 55k$, et son salaire final était de 140k$. Bon, déjà là, on parle d'une très belle croissance de carrière en 10 ans, mais je ne vais pas m'arrêter là-dessus. Ça dit aussi que son employeur faisait un match dans son REER jusqu'à 6% de son salaire. Bon, un très bon employeur aussi. Il dit que son rendement net moyen a été de 11%/an durant ces 10 années. Ça dit qu'il était rendu à 179k$ après 6 ans. Pour se rendre à 179k$ en 6 ans à un rendement de 11%/an, il faut épargner 15k$/an en augmentant progressivement jusqu'à 30k$/an en 6 ans (augmentation d'épargne de 12%/an), considérant sa croissance de carrière. Considérant sa croissance de carrière et la contribution de l'employeur, c'est plausible. Mais encore faut-il passer de 179k$ à 750k$ en 4 ans maintenant. Encore une fois, il manque de gros détails parce que ça dit qu'il avait 179k$ à lui seul en 2017, mais qu'il a combiné avec sa femme en 2019 et qu'ils ont atteint 750k$ combinés en 2022. S'il avait continué seul, il aurait atteint environ 500k$ selon mes hypothèses initiales. Donc là, la magie, c'est surtout la magie d'avoir un gros salaire et un bon employeur, et une femme qui t'aide à atteindre ton montant magique, dont on n'a aucune idée de la valeur de sa contribution (probablement 250k$), sans compter les revenus de son blog. Rappelons aussi que 11% de rendement annuel net de frais c'est au-delà des rendements médians historiques.

Et la troisième histoire avec Modest Millionaire, je ne la saisis pas trop. Bon, on embellit encore en disant qu'elle a commencé à investir à 14 ans (50$/mois); pas de quoi de pertinent parce que plus tard elle mentionne qu'elle a commencé à investir 200$/mois à 24 ans après avoir payé ses dettes d'études. Et là l'histoire c'est qu'elle a investi 200$/mois en 2013 jusqu'à 1500$/mois en 2022 où elle a atteint son CoastFIRE de 450k$. Hmm... si on met 200$/mois jusqu'à 1500$/mois après 9 ans (augmentation annuelle de 25%) et qu'on met le rendement annuel de 11% de l'autre histoire d'avant, on arrive à... 90k$. Ben voyons, c'est loin de 450k$, qu'est-ce que j'ai manqué? Ah, ça dit que 70% de ces 450k$ sont la valeur de transfert de son régime à prestation déterminée du gouvernement fédéral et 11% de l'équité de son logement locatif. Donc, en gros, ce n'est pas une histoire d'investissement liquide à la bourse ça, c'est une histoire d'avoir un régime à prestation déterminée au gouvernement fédéral et d'avoir accédé à la propriété au début des années 2010s (avec son conjoint dont on ne connaît pas la situation financière).

Tout ça pour dire que je ne vois en rien la valeur ajoutée de ces histoires qui sont complètement déconnectées d'une grande majorité de la réalité des travailleurs moyens. Bon, ils ont des blogs et ça attire des visiteurs, mais ce sont surtout des gens dans des situations financières privilégiées semblables. Pour le travailleur moyen, c'est déconnecté, c'est une histoire de licornes et c'est insultant.

Et tout ça, ce n'est pas pour m'en plaindre personnellement, car moi aussi j'ai la grande chance d'être dans une situation financière privilégiée, mais j'ai cette réticence de voir ces histoires en lunettes roses de retraite hâtive dans un livre tout public qui cible les débutants. Je vais dire aux gens de complètement ignorer cette section.

Peut-on avoir un livre qui se limite à vulgariser plusieurs concepts financiers sans vendre du rêve? (Vendre du rêve: ""De zéro à millionnaire"", ""La retraite à 40 ans"", etc)",2025-09-15T03:43:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/comments/1nhfm1d/la_retraite_à_40_ans_comment_ontils_fait/,

Suis-je le seul à être tanné du culte de l’immobilier ?

Bon, est-ce qu’il est possible de faire l’argent avec des blocs? Absolument.

 Est-ce qu’il est possible d’en faire beaucoup? Absolument.

 Est-ce qu’il y a de bons côtés à posséder un bloc : absolument. 

Est-ce que c’est quelque chose d’accessible? Peut-être. 

Est-ce que ça peut être un sideline intéressant? Surêment

Est-ce que c’est la solution à tous les problèmes? Non.

 Je suis tanné de voir des publicités des coachs immobiliers qui nous explique des façons d’acheter des blocs sans mise de fonds en utilisant des manœuvres ultras risquées  

Je suis tanné de lire des récits dignes de Steve Jobs du genre : Il y a quelqu’un qui n’avait pas une cenne, qui gagnait 25K par année et pif paf pouf, s’est mis à l’immobilier et dorénavant, possède 500 «portes» et fait 200k par année. 

Je suis tanné du mot «porte» pour désigner des logements.

Je suis tanné qu’une franche importante de la société, bien souvent défavorisée, pense que les blocs, c’est le messie et/ou le Robin des bois des temps modernes, que grâce à leurs «portes», ils puissent éventuellement se sortir de la pauvreté, vu que c’est vu comme un investissement facile et sans risque.

Je suis tanné de voir des gens penser et dire qu’ils font énormément d’argent grâce à leur investissement en immobilier alors qu’ils en auraient le triple en investissant dans un fonds reproduisant le S&P 500. 

Je suis tanné de voir qu’il est très peu dit qu’avant les blocs soient suffisants pour bien en vivre, il faut en avoir une masse critique et qui soient tous bien rentable.

Où on peut lire la phrase suivante: 

Ton revenu net sera de 109 521 $ et si le prêt est assuré par la SCHL, ton paiement hypothécaire annuel sera de 74 668 $ et les liquidités qui reviendront dans tes poches seront de 34 853 $. Donc tu gagneras environ 35k brut ce qui équivaut à un salaire de 17$ de l’heure. 35 000$ pour travailler environ 3 ou 4 jours par année sur ton bloc.

J'ai fait mon dernier paiement hypothécaire; je devais renouveler pour 5 mois et j'avais assez d'argent comptant pour tout rembourser, et comme les taux augmentaient, j'étais mieux de faire un dernier versement complèt.

En fait, Il me reste 1c à payer. (pour une raison Desjardins/accèsD voulait pas faire le montant total et il me reste 1c à payer ! )   


Aujourd'hui ça change rien, mais dans 1 mois, je vais commencer à avoir plus d'argent dans mes poches.

Après les fêtes, je vais rencontrer ma conseillère pour placer un peu de cet argent dans mes REER et regarder pour un CELI.

J'ai quand même toujours été chanceux pour mon hypothèque.

Les taux ont commencés à baisser autour de 2005 quand j'ai pris mon hypothèque et sont restés bas; les taux ont commencés à remonter juste après mon dernier renouvellement il y a 2 ans.  
  
J'ai toujours pris un taux fixe, j'ai horreur du risque, ça me permettait de bien me budgéter, et à chaque renouvellement, j'essayais de toujours m'arranger pour avoir les mêmes mensualités.

* Je ne possède aucune, mais aucune dette. Aucune carte de crédit, aucun prêt, je ne dois rien à personne, ni aucune banque.
* Cote de crédit 832
* Métier (ma passion): Entraîneur dans une équipe sportive au Québec
* Mon métier me rapporte **53'000$ Brut + 2888$ Net** \- en direction vers 55'000$ l'an prochain.
* **J'ai une conjointe** qui travail aussi et **qui fera 50%** des paiements pour vivre. Elle à rapportée 77'000$ l'an dernier.
* Donc dans le screenshot, **la section ""Dépenses""** c'est les montant que **moi même je débourserai de mon côté.**

3. Et ensuite les montants que je veux avoir de prêt avant d'acheter ma maison vs les montants que j'ai actuellement.
4. Pour les curieux j'ai aussi fait un graphique de ma valeur nettes depuis les dernières années. Ça peut aider à mettre en contexte sachant que selon moi je viens de loin.Les dates du graphiques ne sont pas normalisée parce qu'avant je ne gardais pas en note les données pour ma valeurs nettes très souvent.

Selon moi le $20 101,55 manquant je suis capable d'avoir le tout d'ici janvier/février 2026 en tryhardant. J'ai déjà depuis le 1er janvier 2025 mis de côté 11500$. Oui oui,

(Sans blague en 2023-2024 j'ai économisé 25'000$ en 12 mois avec un salaire de 47'000$ - 50'000$ parce que mes dépenses étaient au niveau le plus radin possible.)

Je débarque là bas, c’est le cas classique du bonhomme de 70 ans qui passe ces soirées à patenter dans son garage parce qu’il ne peut plus sentir sa bonne femme. Il me vend sa tondeuse la moins chère pour juste 60$. Il sait qu’il pourrait vendre ses tondeuses beaucoup plus cher, mais me dit que c’est son passe temps et qu’il aime ça dépanner le monde.

En lui racontant mon histoire, il me propose même de racheter ma tondeuse scrap 20$, car le moteur est récupérable selon lui. Au final, je suis reparti de là avec une tondeuse qui fonctionne A1 pour 40$ et mon ancienne tondeuse a évité le dépotoir.

1cf7gan,Combien ca vaut?,sebmillette,,87,0.91,70,"**Combien ca vaut?**

* C'est la question qui revient le plus souvent.
* C'est 80 % du patrimoine net de pas mal de monde au Québec.
* C'est la question à laquelle les 15 000 courtiers immobiliers du Québec essaient de répondre chaque jour.
* C'est la question que les banques se posent avant d'émettre une hypothèque ou de refinancer.
* C'est la question que les 1100 évaluateurs agréés du Québec se posent lorsqu'ils examinent votre maison et vous demandent : est-ce pour la banque ou pour le gouvernement ?

Tout le monde à une opinion, un tableau Excel, une anecdote, un pro à qui ils font confiance...

Mais personne ne le sait vraiment, combien elle vaut ta maison.

&#x200B;

Je ne le sais pas non plus, mais je sais ce qu'on peut faire ensemble pour le savoir : ***Partager l'information.***

&#x200B;

 Cela fait environ quatre ans que je travaille sur une intelligence artificielle qui calcule les prix de vente des maisons. Elle analyse des données telles que ""celle-là s'est vendue cher parce qu'elle était rénovée"", ""celle-là s'est vendue à un prix moins élevé car elle était située dans un quartier moins attractif"", ou encore ""celle-là s'est vendue à un prix très élevé car elle était en bord de l'eau"". Lorsque nous connaissons la taille de la maison, son état de rénovation et sa situation géographique, notre intelligence artificielle est capable de déterminer sa valeur avec précision. Cependant, le défi réside dans le fait que nous ne savons pas si votre maison est grande ou petite, rénovée ou non. Nous savons simplement où elle se trouve (merci, Google Maps). 

&#x200B;

Inspiré par le [Pixel Board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnRCZK3KjUY) de Reddit  j'ai créé une plateforme communautaire appelée Doormath. Cette plateforme permet à tout le monde de nous fournir des informations structurées sur leur propriété. En échange, notre algorithme fournit une estimation de la valeur de la propriété sur le marché actuel.

À mesure que les gens nous fournissent des informations sur leur logement, notre algorithme s'améliore pour mieux calculer la valeur de chaque propriété !

&#x200B;

Nos objectifs avec cette plateforme sont les suivants :

* Faciliter l'accès à la valeur d'une propriété pour tout le monde, à tout moment.
* Permettre de connaître **avant** une transaction le montant que les banques peuvent prêter sur une propriété.
* Simplifier les transactions immobilière en fournissant un prix non biaisé comme point de départ pour les négociations.
* Réduire les abus.

Vous souhaitez participer ? Vous voulez savoir combien vaut votre maison ou celle de votre voisin ? Entrez les caractéristiques des propriétés que vous connaissez sur [Doormath.ca](https://Doormath.ca). C'est aussi simple que ça.

&#x200B;

Nous évaluons actuellement les MAISONS dans les régions suivantes : Montréal, Laval, Rive-Sud et Rive-Nord. Quant aux CONDOS DIVISES, nous les évaluons dans les régions suivantes : Montréal et Laval. 

Étant donné qu'il existe des variations de prix même à l'intérieur d'un même secteur, notre intelligence artificielle a été en mesure de calculer la différence de valeur en fonction de la localisation pour pratiquement chaque propriété. Vous pouvez consulter cette carte de valeur de localisation sur notre carte interactive ici : [https://www.doormath.ca/explore](https://www.doormath.ca/explore)

&#x200B;

* Vous voulez des détails sur notre algorithme?
* Votre région n'est pas encore couverte?
*  Vous êtes un courtier immobilier et vous souhaitez vous présenter comme professionnel de l'industrie dans un secteur?

Un fonds dont les frais de gestion grimpent à 1,7 %! Selon Frédéric Tremblay, c’est le prix à payer pour l’accompagnement et les conseils qu’on reçoit en succursale. La réalité, c’est qu’en succursale, on est accompagné au minimum, et la qualité du conseil qu’on y trouve est au mieux variable. Les frais élevés reflètent davantage le coût de la structure de vente.

Donc tous ces gens qui vivent à mille à l'heure en ce moment vont vivre en pauvre durant leur retraite? Si c'est le cas, ils vont tomber en méchante dépression durant leurs années de retraite, non? Ou peut-être qu'ils vont être contents d'en avoir pleinement profité durant leurs jeunes années?

Moi, je serais curieux de voir des études qui ont suivi différents choix de vie, différents styles de vie, mais aussi qui illustrent justement des statistiques sur ces choix.

D'un côté, il faut tout de même profiter de nos jeunes années. C'est là qu'on a le plus d'énergie, la meilleure santé et on ne sait jamais ce qui va arriver demain. 

D'un autre côté, on veut atteindre cette indépendance financière qui nous permet de faire ce qu'on veut de notre temps jusqu'à notre dernier jour de vie.

Alors, ces gens qui voyagent beaucoup, plein d'activités, restos, etc., ne seront soudainement plus en mesure de faire tout cela à leur retraite?

1jchb1x,ATTENTION AUX FAUSSES BOUTIQUES BELL,IllustriousRope6499,,78,0.95,8,"Bonjour,

Au cas où vous ne le sauriez pas, il existe des “fausses” boutiques Bell et Virgin qui appartiennent à Cellcom.

Elles sont identiques aux boutiques officielles de Bell, avec des vendeurs portant les uniformes de Bell, mais ces vendeurs travaillent également pour Cellcom.

👉 Leur objectif principal est de vous faire ouvrir une ligne de crédit avec une compagnie associée appelée Flexiti (qui a une très mauvaise réputation et est souvent associée à des pratiques douteuses).

Les stratagèmes utilisés :
	•	Ils pourraient vous dire que Bell ne peut pas financer votre téléphone (ce qui est faux) et vous proposer un financement via Flexiti.
	•	Ils pourraient également prétendre que vous n’êtes pas admissible à l’assurance Bell, vous poussant ainsi vers un financement Flexiti.
	•	Chaque vendeur adapte son discours en fonction de la victime pour vous convaincre d’accepter ce financement.

Des témoignages similaires sur Google :

Les pages d’avis Google de ces boutiques sont remplies de témoignages de clients ayant vécu des situations similaires.

Si vous vous êtes fait avoir :

Si vous pensez avoir été trompé par ces pratiques, je vais faire une demande d’analyse de dossier par la firme d’avocats qui gère déjà le recours collectif contre Bell et ses vendeurs itinérants.

👉 Contactez-moi et faites-moi savoir votre expérience si vous vous êtes fait avoir. Plus nous aurons de témoignages, plus nous pourrons renforcer le dossier.

Envie de vérifier par vous-même ?

Si vous êtes curieux de voir à quel point ces pratiques sont contraires au Code pénal et à la législation de l’OPC (Office de la protection du consommateur), allez voir directement comment ils essaient de vous pousser vers leur ligne de crédit douteuse :

Il est indéniable qu'il existe plusieurs critiques à l'égard de Desjardins. Leurs produits financiers sont souvent moins attractifs que ceux de la concurrence, et leur ""succès"" semble principalement lié au fait qu'ils sont omniprésents au Québec et que beaucoup ouvrent leur premier compte chez Desjardins lorsqu'ils sont jeunes.

Cela étant dit, la force de Desjardins réside peut-être dans son engagement envers la communauté. Dans ma petite ville, la caisse coopérative accorde des commandites à la butte à glisser ainsi qu'à diverses festivités annuelles telles que la Saint-Jean, la fête d'automne et celle d'hiver. De plus, Desjardins soutient financièrement différents groupes tels que le patinage artistique, les scouts, et bien d'autres.

L'impression qui se dégage de tout cela, c'est que l'implication au sein de la communauté est une rareté parmi les banques. Je peux me tromper, mais je n'ai jamais constaté qu'une banque comme la Banque de Montréal, ou toute autre banque, accorde des commandites à un parc ou à un événement local.

Je pense que je viens de me faire bannir d'un groupe Facebook, ""L'argent ne dort jamais"" car j'ai répondu à une madame qui questionnait qu'elle payait beaucoup d'assurances (720 par MOIS) que ses 4 enfants avaient pas besoin d'assurance-vie. Ayoye que le monde est venu argumenter. Je suis restée très polie. La madame a commenté que tout le monde mangeait à sa fin. Ils ont aussi 2 chars très récents (de son post original). J'ai répondu que tant mieux si ça marche pour elle et que j'espèrais qu'ils ne s'endettent pas et qu'ils peuvent économiser pour leur retraite. Elle m'a répondu que chacun a ses priorités et que les assurance-vies pour les enfants sont un besoin. J'espère que vous pouvez lire entre les lignes de sa réponse.

Il y a aussi un ""conseiller à la sécurité financière"" (lire: un individu ayant été formé 6 mois par une compagnie vendant une gamme de produits financiers) qui est venu me dire que je disais des bêtises et basically de me la fermer. Je l'ai challengé en disant que c'est normal qu'il soit pas content puisque je questionne l'utilité d'un produit qu'il vend, et que moi, je suis indépendante. Il a commencé à déblatérer.

Je suis comptable agrée, pas pl fin, mais j'aimerais ça. J'ai néanmoins eu des cours de planif fin et un des souvenirs les plus vivaces de ces cours est le grand Eric Brassard qui est venu nous expliquer les principes fondamentaux de la pl fin, avec une parenthèse sur les assurances-vies des enfants que beaucoup de parents prennent mais qui ne sont pas un produit vraiment utile parce que les enfants n'ont pas de revenus à remplacer, à leur décès (entre autres explications, c'est long à détailler ici). 
On dirait que c'est émotionnel et que les parents ont cette pensée non formulée que cette assurance-vie va empêcher leur enfant de mourir. Et que dire de l'excellent marketing des IA de ce monde!!!

Ok, rant fini. Je suis mère aussi en passant. Puis je suis d'accord avec toi si ta pensée est que je me prends pour une Pierre-Yves McSween version féminine. Donnez-moi pas trop de hate s'il-vous-plaît, j'ai eu ma dose de la journée.

Edit: Précision que le 720$ est pour la maison (200 000$), les deux chars quasi-neufs et l'assurance-vie de 4 enfants et deux adultes.

Canada’s official poverty line, the Market Basket Measure (MBM), is a low-income threshold that compares disposable income with the cost of a specific basket of goods and services, representing a modest, basic standard of living. According to the MBM, a family lives in poverty if they cannot afford the cost of this basket in their community.

* In 2021, [7.4% of Canada’s population](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2023021-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24) lived in poverty, up from 6.4% in 2020.
* [Provisional estimates](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2022008-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24) show that this percentage may be up to 9.8% in 2022.
* The most recent [poverty dashboard of indicators](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2023021-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24) shows that, in 2021, 12.9% of Canadians faced food insecurity and 7.9% of people aged 16 and older had unmet health needs and did not receive health care when they felt they needed it. 
* Each year, MBM basket costs are adjusted to account for inflation, and every five years, the MBM basket undergoes a [complete review and update](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/75f0002m/75f0002m2023007-eng.htm?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24). The last such update was in 2018.

1gagnd9,Update : Moins peur du lifestyle creep,Rosaeliya,Budget,70,0.94,20,"OG: https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/s/Nihbe3xf6G

Il y a un mois, j'ai publié parce que j'avais trop paniqué lorsque j'ai reçu ma première paie.

Je voulais prendre le temps de remercier tout le monde qui m'a poussé à me renseigner, qui a répondu à mes questions et qui m'ont donné des conseils budgétaires.

Aujourd'hui, mon CELIAPP est maximisé. 50% de mon salaire est envoyé dans mes comptes EPSP et CELI de façon automatique le jour de ma paie. Tout est mis dans des ETF S&P 500 et en CASH.TO pour tout ce qui est plus ""court terme"". C'est un portfolio avec un risque que je me sens confortable d'avoir.

30% est ausi envoyé de façon automatique dans un compte saving pour payer mes besoins.

20% m'est attribué. C'est une allocation que je me sens confortable de dépenser. J'ai juste assez dans mon compte bancaire juste pour ne pas payer les frais et mon allocation.

J'utilise mon application bancaIre pour suivre mes dépenses à la source. C'est la meilleure façon pour moi de suivre mes dépenses et avoir des notifcations de ceux-ci.

Et je consulte maintenant une psychologue pour parler de mon anxiété concernant l'argent en général.

Je suis fière de moi d'avoir fait les changements nécessaires pour réduire mon anxiété et d'avoir cherché de l'aide même si ça a commencé par un post Reddit.

Merci encore (:

1nlw3fx,Est-ce que vous partagez à votre partenaire amoureux.se l'état de vos finances?,FckThePope,Divers,70,0.89,123,"J'ai eu par le passé une longue relation où j'étais très transparente envers mon partenaire qui a su que j'avais des économies importantes (dépendamment pour qui mais pour moi, 100K$ à 26 ans c'était énorme). Il savait que j'avais travaillé fort et économisé pour mon argent, personne ne m'a fait de cadeaux.

Malgré tout, j'ai senti de la jalousie et depuis, je garde mes finances secrètes. Mon ex m'a fait des remarques exemple : ""C'est pas moi qui a XXK$ dans son compte bancaire"", etc. pour justifier qu'il n'avait pas les moyens de se payer un voyage, par exemple. Ou bien quand on a cassé et qu'il n'avait pas les moyens de me rembourser un prêt.

Mes autres partenaires, depuis, savent seulement que je gère bien mes affaires et que je suis à l'aise financièrement (exemple je manque jamais d'argent pour de gros imprévus, j'ai une sécurité d'emploi, j'ai un condo à moi seule, etc.). Avec mon partenaire actuel, nous n'avons aucun gros plan, c-a-d, pas d'enfants projetés, pas d'achat de propriété en vue, PEUT-ÊTRE une voiture ensemble un jour. On connaît nos salaires cependant (ils sont publics lol).

L'argent est jamais un critère pour moi en couple, ce qui fait que j'ai toujours eu des partenaires moins économes que moi, mais avec d'autres qualités.

Je suis curieuse de savoir à quel point les autres personnes sont transparentes en couple, niveau argent.

Est-ce que votre partenaire sait combien d'économies vous avez? Est-ce que cela a insécurisé votre partenaire si celui-ci avait peu ou pas d'économies?

Est-ce que le fait que je sois une femme avec plus d'argent qu'un homme peut en venir à insécuriser ce dernier?

1g1dah5,La réforme de l'aide sociale: d'une tristesse sans nom pour les plus vulnérables,useless_mostly52,,70,0.79,35,"Je viens de finir de regarder les travaux à l'Assemblée Nationale, avec les différents acteurs du milieu. Des points tellement importants ont été apportés mais...on sent que c'est déjà décidé d'avance. 

Ce qui me touche personnellement, c'est qu'on a absolument rien entendu sur les personnes ayant des contraintes sévères et permanentes, reconnues. Les personnes comme moi qui ne peuvent pas POUR VRAI, occuper un emploi et doivent continuer à vivre avec le même montant misérable par mois, alors qu'elle ne peuvent PAS améliorer leur situation, et que cette réforme supposément humanisante et moderne, a oublié. Rien. Restons en dessous du seuil de pauvreté acceptable. La CAQ cette année a augmenter leur salaire, parce que, et je cite, ils devaient s'ajuster par rapport au cout de la vie. 

Et nous? Nous ne méritons pas cet ajustement? 

 En plus, on veut nous obliger à faire réévaluer notre éligibilité annuellement. Sérieux, ces grands décideurs et pousseux de crayon n'ont surement jamais fait l'expérience de ce processus.......:(  C'est long, très difficile, décourageant et c'est le médecin du gouvernement ( dont le mandat est de limité l'éligibilité de ces personnes) qui a le dernier mot. Croient-ils que tout le monde a accès facilement à un médecin ou un psychiatre, surtout en région???? Dans quel monde vivent-ils. Les itinérants pour la plupart ont le montant de base, justement parce que c'est trop difficile pour eux de faire ces démarches, alors que la grand majorité ont des contraintes sévères!!!!! C'est dégueulasse. On veut couper les gens qui ont 58 ans et plus, alors que c'est cette population qui est le plus à risque d'itinérance depuis les dernières années!!! Je perds de plus en plus l'envie de vivre. J'ai 52 ans, et je ne vois que ma situation empirer. Je ne vois plus d""espoir, je sais que si je vieillit, je vais vieillir misérablement, pauvrement, et malade. Abandonnée par le gouvernement supposé s'occuper des gens comme moi. Je me sens comme un parasite qu'on veut pousser vers le suicide, à force de l'invalider et l'appauvrir. Allez, va t-en. Le monde de demain veut éliminer la pauvreté? Non, c'est le pauvre qu'on veut éliminer. 

Ce qui me rends le plus triste, c'est qu'on a choisi d'aller piger dans la poche déjà vide des plus pauvres, pour remplir les coffres de l'état. On parle de 98 millions qu'ils veulent récupérer. WOW bravo, quel beau calcul!!!!!!!  C'est quoi cette logique? Je ne comprends pas. 

Je suis sur les contraintes sévères depuis des années, et là je vis dans la peur de voir ma situation empirer, et j'en suis venue à souhaiter que l'aide médicale à mourir me soit disponible, dans l'éventualité où ma vie deviendrait encore plus misérable, et que mon existence ne soit plus possible, dans ces conditions. 

Le mode survie, pour toujours. C'est ce que j'ai entendu dans ces discussions au parlement. 

Sombre temps pour être vivante, tout en se sentant de plus en plus morte en dedans.

1ljbwd4,"A la croisée des chemins, je cherche avis extérieur",Due-Ad2796,,67,0.99,63,"Bonjour,

Je me retrouve a la croisée des chemins. Je suis au bout du rouleau professionnel.  
Je travail dans mon domaine depuis plus de 32 ans, ayant commencé a 18 ans et me voila rendu a 50 ans.  
Père de famille (7, 10, 12 ans) dont 1 lourdement handicapé . Maman a la maison qui prends soin de nos enfants a temps pleins. Nous sommes mariés depuis que nous avons 18 ans et nous sommes heureux ensemble malgré les difficultés de la vie.

J'ai longtemps étudié en même temps que le travail et je me retrouve a 50 ans, fatigué et rongé par les heures et le stress du travail (Poste de haute direction). J'ai un bac en informatique, en administration, certificat en ressources humaines, en histoire et une bonne dizaine de formations diverses en informatique (Cisco, Fortinet, azure, PMP etc.. ). Pour la première fois de ma vie, je me sens a plat. Il arrive que je pleurs un peu dans le char rendu au travail. Je consulte un professionnel pour discuter de tout ca. A l'heure actuel, je travail 60h/semaine puis lorsque j'arrive a la maison, je donne le meilleur répits possible a ma conjointe et je prend un peu la relève.

Nos économies sont ok sans être exceptionnel. On a du déboursé pas mal pour la compagnie de ma conjointe vu la situation avec notre enfant.  On a englouti 100 000$ avant de fermer la compagnie.

Par contre les dépenses sont très légères. J'ai été frugal pas mal toute ma vie. Les dépenses sont reliés a des expériences (amusement des enfants), soins divers, équipements adaptés ou pour envoyer notre enfant 2 fin de semaine par année dans un endroit afin de nous donner un répits. La supervision étant 24h sur 24.

Notre seul auto est une 2022 adaptée et elle est payé (60k).  
La maison est payé (650k)  
Les dépenses totales sont de 5000$ par mois, le reste s'en va en économie (+5000$ par mois)

Salaire actuel de 150 000$+ (bonus annuel entre 0 et 25 000$), ont reçoit aussi 1000$ par mois clair pour les enfants.  
Celi - moi : toper (160 000$) - VEQT  
Celi - conjointe : 100 000$ mais il reste 15 000$ de jeu (rempli d'ici la fin d'année) - VEQT  
REER - moi : 400 000$ - VGRO  
REEE : on aura 50 000 par enfants (2) - XBAL  
REEI : 100 000$

Je sais qu'il est difficile de donner des conseils a un inconnu avec si peu de renseignement.  
Ce que j'aurais le gout de faire présentement c'est tout abandonné et partir avec un sac a dos pendant 3 mois, seul (bien sur je ferai jamais ca). Mais c'est vous dire comment je me sens.

Laisser tomber mon boulot, c'est beaucoup d'argent mis sur la table.

Je me demande si je pourrais par vivre de side hustle pour le plaisir (Je suis assez bon en informatique, j'ai entendu parlé de marketing digital mais je ne sais pas si ca marche vraiment?).  
Je pourrais aussi rester a mon emploi et empiler du surplus (prendre 2000$ par mois pour avoir une aide ponctuel a la maison?)

Je suis perdu, lorsque j'en parle avec ma conjointe, elle n'a pas vraiment d'opinion, elle me dire de faire ce qui est le mieux pour moi mais je sais qu'elle est inquiète pour la famille aussi.

Même si je n'ai pas de réponse ici, ca m'a fait du bien de l'écrire :)

Ayant personnellement un prêt dans les cinq chiffres, ça représente plus de 1,000$ par année. 

Ce qui me fâche, c'est que le fédéral a annulé les intérêts sur les prêts étudiants partout au pays, il y avait de l'argent de la part du fédéral pour réduire ceux-ci. La Colombie Britannique a rendu les prêts étudiants de manière permanente à 0%. L'Ontario a une portion fédérale qui est à 0% et une portion provinciale qui est à 7.45% (il est possible de rembourser uniquement la portion provinciale dans un paiement). Au Québec, le prêt est au complet à intérêt à partir du 1er avril. 

Quelqu'un qui vient de finir ses études universitaires et qui a un faible salaire est le grand perdant du budget selon moi, puisqu'il ne pourra pas bénéficier au complet de la baisse d'impôt et devra payer de forts intérêts sur ses dettes.

Pourquoi ce sujet m'intéresse-t-il pas davantage les journalistes? C'était presque pas mentionné dans les articles sur le budget.

Informez aussi vos proches qui viennent de finir leurs études, c'est important d'être au moins au courant.

« On a fait des calculs avec mon mari, et ça serait trop onéreux de mettre notre fils en garderie non subventionnée pour qu’on puisse travailler tous les deux. Mon mari gagne plus que moi. Ce sera lui qui restera à travailler et moi qui resterai à la maison. »

J’ai du mal à calculer comment ça peut devenir trop onéreux de passer de la garderie subventionnée à la garderie privée au point où cette mère doit cesser de travailler ? Une place en garderie subventionnée revient à 9,35$ par jour. En milieu privée, ça tourne autour de 50$ par jour auquel on soustrait le crédit d’impôt pour frais de garde de 67% (au plus bas) ce qui revient à 16,50$. La différence est de seulement 7,35$. Je comprends qu’à deux salaires, on perd en allocations familiales mais au point où ça ne vaille plus du tout la peine de travailler ? En plus, elle reçoit des avantages sociaux en travaillant comme fonds de pension, assurances etc. Quelqu’un voit qqch que je ne vois pas ?

1jmw25g,La fameuse assurance Hypothécaire,Educational-Leg8673,,61,0.97,40,"Salut à tous,

Je voulais partager une réflexion après avoir magasiné mon hypothèque récemment.

Comme beaucoup, la banque m’a proposé de “protéger” mon prêt avec leur assurance hypothécaire. Ça avait l’air pratique : tout est inclus dans le paiement, pas besoin de penser à rien.

Mais après avoir fouillé un peu… j’ai réalisé que cette assurance protège surtout la banque, pas ma famille.

Voici les grandes différences que j’ai découvertes (voir visuel joint aussi) :
	•	La banque est le bénéficiaire de l’assurance (pas ma conjointe)
	•	La couverture diminue au fur et à mesure que je rembourse mon prêt
	•	Si je change de prêteur, je perds la protection
	•	L’évaluation médicale se fait au moment du décès (!), donc y’a un risque de refus de réclamation

Finalement, j’ai pris une assurance vie temporaire personnelle 25 ans (durée du prêt):
	•	Le montant est fixe
	•	C’est ma conjointe qui reçoit l’argent, pas la banque
	•	Ça couvre même plus que juste l’hypothèque
	•	Et c’est moi qui garde le contrôle

Ce n’est pas pour tout le monde, mais je pense que c’est important que les gens sachent qu’il y a une meilleure option que ce que les banques proposent par défaut.",2025-03-29T16:57:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/comments/1jmw25g/la_fameuse_assurance_hypothécaire/,

Alors je recommence à regarder le marché. Je suis pré-approuvé pour 350k$ à 5% d'intérêts (5 ans), ceci incluant un 50k$ qui repose présentement dans mon CELI.

Mais 350k$ en 2024... ishhhh. J'ai le choix entre faire 1h-1h30 de char pour me rendre à Montréal quand je travail du bureau, ou me contenter d'un petit condo vraiment très très ordinaire. Avec taxes et frais de condo, ça va me coûter pareil 23-2400$ par mois! Un bon 6-700$ de plus que mon apart. Mais si je mets cet argent de côté, ça augmente juste mon pouvoir d'achat de 7-8k$ l'an prochain. Si le marché monte de plus que 3-4%, retour à la case départ. Et soyons clair, mon loyer est beaucoup plus nice que ce que je peux m'acheter, c'est neuf, bien insonorisé, grand, lumineux, etc. Mais c'est pas à moi et le loyer va juste aller en montant.

Autant payer 21k$ par année en loyer me pue au nez, autant payer 350k$ pour un 4 et demi me donne le goût de vômir. 

Ma crainte:

\- Si je reste en appart et que le marché recommence à monter, je pourrais me retrouver en pire position encore et être prisonnier du bail pour le restant de ma vie.

\- Si j'achète et que finalement le marché stagne ou même diminue (sérieusement, combien de temps on peut soutenir ça ces prix là? ), ben je me retrouve avec un condo que je peux pas vendre. Entre la SCHL, la commission de l'agent et la taxe de bienvenu, va falloir je reste là 3 à 5 ans minimum. 3 à 5 ans à payer 23-2400$ par mois pour vivre dans un condo moins hot que mon logement à 1750$...

Durant les 25 dernières années, j'ai produit mes déclarations de revenus seulement 4 ou 5 fois (à coup de 4 ou 5 années). Oui, avec les frais de retards et les intérêts qui s'acculument. J'ai durant ce temps eu un mix de revenus travailleur autonome / dividendes d'entreprise, et je me rammasse toujours avec un gros bill en impôt à la fin de l'année. J'ai été sur des arrangements de paiements autant au fédéral qu'au provincial. Et j'ai oublié de faire des paiements plus souvent qu'autrement.

Durant ces 20 années, je me suis fait saisir mes comptes bancaires probablement 20 fois par le gouvernement. J'ai vécu avec un genre de stress constant, à me demander à quel moment dans l'année je me retrouverai avec mes comptes vidés, saisis, avec un montant à trouver pour débloquer ça. Le stress que ma conjointe débarque dans le salon en me disant ""C\*\*\*\*s le compte conjoint est encore gelé"".

Le pire c'est que ce n'est pas un problème d'argent, juste de négligence. J'ai accès à du crédit (marge de crédit de 50k$, 2 cartes de crédits (une à 25k$, une à 30k$). Ça me permettait de faire taire le gouvernement, et j'ai toujours payé les cartes, et travaillé pourles maintenir vivantes. C'est juste avec le gouvernement que mon cerveau tilt.. 

Bref, il y a plus de deux ans, j'ai décidé de faire du ménage, de tout payer pour avoir la paix. Je suis passé en mode ""Ok gars, c'est l'heure"". Ça a été de la job, mais j'arrive au bout, je ne leur doit plus que 12k$. (ça peut sembler gros, mais croyez moi je suis parti de très loin). Je vais faire ce paiement la semaine prochaine. Je vais être à zéro. Je me sens libre comme pas possible.

En plus, j'ai découvert ce Subreddit, me suis intéressé à ça. J'ai lu le livre de Zéro à millionnaire de Nicolas Bérubé (que je recommande). J'ai découvert c'est quoi un FNB, un FPI. J'ai ouvert un compte Wealthsimple, j'ai eu l'impression de découvrir le feu. J'ai commencé tranquillement avec de l'argent dans leur compte géré, transformé ça en ZSP, XEQT (je sais, c'est un peu redondant). Un peu d'argent dans des REIT avec dividendes. Tout ça dans un compte enregistré (REER). 

Bref, d'ici 1 semaine, je ne devrai plus rien au gouvernement. Et ils vont me faire un chèque lorsque je ferai ma déclaration d'impôt pcq j'ai côtisé en tabarshpouel. Je suis loin d'avoir ce dont j'ai besoin pour un jour penser à une retraite, mais je suis sur une track qui me laisse penser que ça se peut.

*(Je précise que j'ai demandé aux mods avant de poster ceci :) )* 

Je suis journaliste à La Presse et je suis en train de préparer un reportage sur les «forever renters», ces personnes qui décident de **rester locataires même si elles ont les moyens d'acheter une propriété**, idéalement parce qu'elles trouvent que ça fait plus de sens d'un point de vue financier dans leur situation. 

En étant dans une situation similaire, je trouve qu'il manque d'outils de départ pour permettre à des lecteurs intéressés de calculer combien ils devraient mettre de côté chaque mois en prévision de la retraite s'ils restent locataires pour pouvoir continuer à payer leur loyer et que ça «remplace» la prise de valeur d'une propriété. On ne peut pas faire le tour de la question dans un seul article, mais on peut probablement avoir des bases de réflexion, et ça me semble utile dans un contexte où le marché de l'immobilier est de plus en plus difficile à pénétrer avec un salaire moyen.

J'en viens à la demande que j'ai pour vous : pour rendre le dossier plus vivant, **je suis à la recherche de témoignages de forever renters québécois**. J'essaie habituellement d'éviter les appels à tous sur les réseaux sociaux ou Reddit pour en trouver, mais plusieurs pistes que j'ai suivies ne m'ont pas menée exactement au profil que je recherche, donc je prends une chance ici.

  Le problème c’est que récemment il y a 2-3 semaines je me suis dit que ça faisait un moment que je voyais l’option de faire du trading d’options et ma curiosité a fait en sorte que je l’essaye. J’avais 200$ sur Wealthsimple et je suis passé à 50$ en 2-3 jours , car je l’avais mis Nvdia en pensant que ça allait monter, mais ça n’a fait que baisser. Lorsque j’ai voulu inverser , le résultat était le même vu que l’action avait commencé à remonter alors que je pensais que ça allait baisser . Le pire c’est que la journée que j’ai fermé mes options d’actions, la journée après Nvdia a remonté pendant 3-4 jours ce qui m’aurait permis de réduire mes pertes . Vous pouvez imaginer la malchance que j’ai alors que d’habitude j’ai jamais eu de pertes majeures à ce niveau quand j’investissais seul. Voilà l’histoire de mon expérience avec les options dans la bourse et je vous laisse une photo du résultat final.😅 Même si que je remonte ailleurs au moins un peu mais on verra si je vais remonter assez haut ou pas.

1h5fs7z,"Pères ayant la garde complète, avez-vous eu une pension alimentaire et si oui, est-elle établie sur des barèmes 'normaux'?",,,58,0.93,54,"Après dix ans de  Cour, DPJ, de plaintes de police répétée, d'expertises et de dizaines Amilliers de dollars en avocat, j'ai fini par obtenir la garde de mes enfant il y a un an.

Ca n'aurai jamais dû durer aussi longtemps vu l'état de la mère, mais quand l'autre parti invoque n'importe quoi (accusation de violence, pédophilie, drogue, et j'en passe) dans des ordonnances de sauvegarde et des remises à ne plus finir, ca peut être long longtemps.   Surtout quand on est constamment dans les cordages et qu'on doit prouver qu'on est pas un agresseur.   



Mais bon, tout cela est fini, la madame a fini par tout perdre.  Par contre, je me demande si je ne devrais pas refaire une requête pour la pension alimentaire.   Mon ex me paie une pension de 140$/mois alors que je payais pas loin de 1200$ pour les deux mêmes enfants et elle prétend (aux enfants du moins) faire 200 000$ par année.   Elle a un paquet de compagnies bidons à son nom au registraire.



Quand on lui a demandé ses revenus elle nous a envoyé un petit montant quelconque dans un courriel (aucun document) et elle nous a dit qu'elle était trop PTSD (à cause de moi) pour travailler, même si sur les réseaux sociaux elle se vante d'être une workhaolic grindset femme à succès power E-mom-Musk.   J'en mets, mais c'est pas loin de ça.   

J'ai voulu faire avancer le dossier et mettre fin à tout ça parce qu'on avançait sur des intérimaires et je lui payais encore une pension complète malgré que les enfants habitaient chez nous désormais.  Je voulais juste arrêter l'hémorragie et passer à autre chose.

Mais je regrette un peu puisque quand je regarde son train de vie, ca cadre avec ses dires.  Le char neuf à chaque années, 4-5 gros voyages par années,  des hotels à mille dollars la nuit dans lesquelles elle amène mes fils quand elle les voit un fois au trois mois.  Son conjoint a beaucoup de sous, mais je serais surpris qu'il paie tout ça.

Mon avocat me dit de laisser faire.  Il m'a répondu ""vous allez me payer et elle va s'arranger pour ne pas payer et rien fournir""  Je lui ai dit qu'elle y était tenu par la loi, c'est écrit noir sur blanc dans le code civil et il m'a regardé avec pitié, comme si j'étais un enfant naif.  Je lui ai dit que j'ai des screenshot de son train de vie et même de ses dires qu'elle est riche et il m'a répondu ""elle va juste dire que c'est un cadeau, que sa situation a changé ou que vous avez photoshoppé ca""   

C'est un avocat émérite avec une excellente réputation, mais j'ai envi de penser qu'il doit bien avoir un peu plus de justice au sujet de la pension.  Je peux comprendre ce biais envers les mères pour les droits d'accès, que les juges sont sur les breaks quand il y a des accusations lancées, mais pour la pension je ne comprends pas, le calcul est super simple.  

Quand je n'avais pas la garde, j'étais à contrat et je changeais souvent d'employeur.  Il fallait donc reviser la pension et le juge se foutait totalement si mes revenus avait fluctué à la baisse et il me sacrait une pension par la tête basé sur mon avis de cotisation en dedans de cinq minutes.  Et si madame se plaignait de mon train de vie, il m'assignait un revenu plus haut, sur le banc.   Quelques jours plus tard Revenu Québec me courrait après pour que je donne les infos de mon nouveau service de paie.   Disons qu'il n'y avait pas beaucoup de place à l'interprétation.  



Je ne vois pas pourquoi quelque chose d'aussi peu subjectif que l'argent ne s'appliquerait pas aux mères.  Pourtant, j'ai plusieurs de gars qui ont la garde complète dans ma famille et mes amis, et c'est toujours la même chose, si la maman envoie quatre 25 cennes par mois, c'est pas pire.   Quand ils demandent de contribuer davantage, ils se font traiter de cheap, et les accusations sont jamais loins.  Au pire ca fini en médiation et le papa obtient des miettes et se faire dire qu'il est chanceux de pas payer d'avocat.

Avant qu'on me dise que j'arrive  de la manosphère, c'est ma nouvelle conjointe qui me demande de faire quelque chose.  Elle en a plein son casque de voir la mère vivre la grosse vie alors que moi je devais payer.   Ce n'est pas tant pour l'argent, on manque de rien, mais le principe.

Avant de partir une requête contre ma super ex, je veux voir mes chances de succès.  À date elles semblent nulles, mais je cherche des pères qui reçoivent une pension normale, basé sur le barèmes des pensions alimentaires.  Pas juste des montants dérisoires 'garocher' dans les airs pour épargner la mère.   Ca doit bien exister.

Ceux-ci  semblent devoir être backés à 100% par des placements liquides (ex: cash ou Tbills). 

Ça veut dire qu’une banque ne peut pas prendre cet argent et faire autre chose de rentable que de le garder en cash ou acheter des Tbills (je simplifie un peu). Je les vois mal offrir un taux d’intérêts plus haut que Tbill dans les prochains jours pour les dépôts des Cash ETFs.

1m1jp52,Mes 8 commandements de la finance perso.,brucealar,,55,0.91,23,"Bonjour,

Après beaucoup de lecture et une quantité atroce d’heures passées sur YouTube, je me suis construit une recette en lien avec les finances personnelles, que je crois rendue assez complète. Je cherche aujourd’hui à obtenir vos conseils constructifs et vos points d’amélioration en lien avec ces 8 commandements!

\*À noter qu’ils sont légèrement personnalisés à ma propre situation financière et doivent être interprétés en ce sens.

\*\*Certains points pourraient être fragmentés en plusieurs dizaines d’autres, mais je souhaitais conserver le tout sous forme de sommaire.

1. Apprendre les bases de la finance personnelle (ex. : types de comptes, les baby steps, les deux livres de Nicolas Bérubé, The Psychology of Money de Morgan Housel, Jack Bogle, Warren Buffett, FNB tout-en-un, podcast Finances Fondamentales, etc.)
2. Comprendre les facteurs de création et de destruction de la richesse (ex. : surconsommation, dettes, intérêts composés, bons/mauvais comportements, etc.)
3. Comprendre les frais de gestion et leurs impacts.
4. Connaître mon profil d’investisseur, ma tolérance au risque, mes plans pour le futur, mes buts et objectifs (S.M.A.R.T.).
5. Élaborer un budget, un plan d’investissement et de décaissement basé sur l’investissement à long terme dans des FNB diversifiés à faibles coûts (...EQT, ...VRO, ...BAL, etc.)
6. Appliquer la stratégie du dollar-cost averaging, ne pas tenter de timer le marché, mettre les émotions de côté et faire preuve de patience (c’est un marathon d’environ 17 à 20 ans dans mon cas.)
7. Pendant le marathon : apprendre à en profiter (équilibre ente les finances ET voyages, petits plaisirs, etc.) et éviter les comparaisons.
8. Après le marathon : appliquer une stratégie de décaissement optimisée en mettant de l’avant mes buts et ambitions. Cela doit être life fulfilling : Barista FIRE, famille, terre/maison/projets personnels/voyages, etc.

\*\*\*À noter que je me suis inspiré, à la base, d’un livre que j’ai lu il y a un moment. Malheureusement, j’ai complètement oublié le nom de l’auteur et je ne parviens plus à le retrouver dans mes notes. Si j’avais eu le nom, je l’aurais cité comme source, mais bon… EDIT: le livre en question est « Beat the Bank » de Larry Bates

1lbpqwo,2 ans & 53000km en électrique plus tard,BootyAndMoney,Véhicule,55,0.82,100,"Bonjour, j’ai vu plusieurs publications ces derniers jours à propos des voitures électriques. Je ne suis pas ici pour en vendre une, mais j’ai suivi mes propres chiffres depuis deux ans et je me suis dit que ça pourrait en intéresser certains.

J’ai acheté une Tesla Model Y il y a exactement deux ans. Le prix payé était de 59 990 $ + taxes, pour un total de 68 973 $. En arrondissant à 70 000 $ pour inclure les frais connexes, ça donne une bonne base. Je ne parlerai pas du financement, car c’est trop variable d’une personne à l’autre.

Sur ces 70 000 $, j’ai reçu 12 000 $ en subventions, donc le coût net de la voiture était de 58 000 $.

Aujourd’hui, j’ai 52 790 km au compteur. La valeur de revente estimée pour mon kilométrage et l’année-modèle tourne autour de 38 000 $, ce qui représente une dépréciation de 20 000 $, soit environ 34,5 % sur deux ans.

Concernant la recharge, je n’avais pas de borne à la maison donc j’ai été 100 % dépendant des bornes publiques ou de prises chez des proches. J’ai utilisé 9 380 kWh, ce qui m’aurait coûté environ 1 125,60 $ si j’avais tout rechargé à domicile au tarif résidentiel.

Mais en réalité, je suis à à 868,25 $ de dépenses réelles en électricité. J’ai la chance d’avoir accès à des bornes gratuites au travail, et je ne me gêne pas non plus pour repérer les bornes gratuites lors de mes déplacements. Oui, un peu ratchet sur les bords, mais ça fait une belle différence à la longue.

Côté entretien, j’ai fait deux nettoyages de freins, remplacé le filtre de cabine une fois, effectué trois changements pneus été/hiver, et j’ai aussi eu un pneu éclaté. Total des frais d’entretien : 934,72 $.

En ce qui concerne les autres frais, j’ai fait installer des barres de toit, acheté des pneus d’hiver et fait teinter les vitres, pour un total de 2 149,23 $.

J’ai également eu un accrochage, mais les assurances ont tout couvert. La facture des réparations s’élevait à 7 355,04 $.

En bout de ligne, je suis pas mal certain que ce n’est pas nécessairement un excellent move financier, mais mon expérience jusqu’à maintenant est presque parfaite. J’ai fait plusieurs longs road trips, et honnêtement, je ne suis pas convaincu que j’aurais autant roulé si j’avais eu une voiture à essence.

Si jamais vous avez des questions, j’aime bien en discuter!",2025-06-14T22:36:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuebecFinance/comments/1lbpqwo/2_ans_53000km_en_électrique_plus_tard/,

Le directeur des ventes m’appelle plus tard pour s’excuser et me dire qu’il augmentait le prix payer pour mon véhicule et qu’il pouvait me le faire a 330$\ 2 semaines et que j’avais un véhicules plus équiper que lui a la base que je voulait mais je devait donner un cash down de 1500$ ce qui me dérange pas donc j’accepte.

Hier ont m’appelle pour me dire que le véhicules es au concessionnaire et que je peut venir le chercher mais que le prix es rendu a 357$ donc je demande le pourquoi on me répond du au financement on a du ajusté le prix sinon je ne passait pas a banque je tien a preciser j’ai une cote de 830 au credit et valeur net +400k donc je ne comprend pas, et lui me repond c’est comme ca ou je doit donner plus d’argent ou payer 357$/2 semaines je cancel tout .

Il s’agit maintenant du seuil officiel de la pauvreté au Canada. En bref, la MPC correspond à un panier de biens et de services qui comprend

🏠 le logement

🥕 la nourriture

👕 les vêtements

🚌 le transport

📱 les autres nécessités.

Les coûts de ces cinq composantes sont additionnés pour obtenir un seuil, qui est considéré comme le montant minimum dont une famille a besoin pour avoir un niveau de vie de base modeste au-dessus du seuil de la pauvreté. Ce seuil varie d’un océan à l’autre, et entre les collectivités rurales et urbaines, afin de bien représenter les différences dans les coûts selon la région.

Donc, qu’est-ce qui constitue un niveau de vie de base modeste au Canada?

Afin d’assurer une mesure précise de la pauvreté partout au pays, un bref [questionnaire anonyme](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/MPC?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24) est maintenant disponible pour permettre à l’ensemble des Canadiens et Canadiennes de donner leur avis sur ce que représente ce « niveau de vie de base » dans leur province ou leur collectivité.

The Market Basket Measure, or MBM, was created in the early 2000s to reflect differences in living costs across the country. It’s now Canada’s Official Poverty Line. In simple terms, the MBM is a basket of goods and services made up of

🏠 shelter

🥕 food

👕 clothing

🚌 transportation

📱 other necessities.

The costs of these five components are added together to produce a threshold, which is considered the minimum amount of money a family needs to have a modest, basic standard of living above the poverty line. This threshold varies from coast to coast, and between rural and urban communities, to reflect differing costs by region.

So what constitutes a modest, basic standard of living in Canada?

To ensure accurate measurement of poverty throughout the country, a short [anonymous questionnaire](http://www.statcan.gc.ca/MBM?utm_source=rddt&utm_medium=smo&utm_campaign=statcan-statcan-MBM-MPC-23-24) is now available for all Canadians to complete and help provide input on what this “basic standard of living” looks like in their province or their community. **Please participate—your opinion is important to us!**

I later found out and was furious, so I went back myself to confront them and return it for her, which luckily worked out.

Now she’s receiving messages from the employee’s personal number trying to make her feel bad about the situation??? What the hell is this? 

We have since completely cancelled her Fido plan and don’t want anything to do with that horrible company.

Has anyone else experienced this before? This has to be against their policy.

Sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit I just didn’t know where else to post it. ",2025-09-17T15:13:40,https://i.redd.it/8i64ead8yrpf1.jpeg,

1it1hxt,"L'enfer du déneigement, vu de l'opérateur.",Big_477,:Dfl: Discussion,2886,0.97,492,"Bonjour tout le monde,

Je suis col-bleu à Montréal depuis maintenant 15 ans, et en cette période exceptionnelle de forte neige je pense que beaucoup de mes collègues aimeraient exprimer publiquement ce qui suit (mais avec plus de sacres).

En tant que bleus, on sait tous ce qu'est d'être citoyens et être pris dans le trafic à cause du déneigement, de marcher dans 1pi de neige (achète-toi des bottes d'hiver avant de chialer). Mais ce que certains citoyens semblent oublier c'est qu'eux n'ont aucune idée de notre travail et des conditions/dangers qui y sont reliés.

Les opérations de déneigement devraient encore durer une semaine. C'est l'enfer, notre machinerie ne fournit pas et nous travaillons 60-70h/semaine, 24h/24 il y a des équipes qui travaillent.  On fournit au 1/3 de l'habitude. Outre les bris mécaniques et pépins reliés à la job, ce sont les citoyens qui sont la plus grande cause de perte de temps.

À toutes les fois où un automobiliste s'aventure dans notre lieu de travail, un piéton, un cycliste, à toutes les fois où quelqu'un attend qu'on ait complètement arrêté d'avancer pour se tasser de notre chemin, quand quelqu'un  park en double pour déposer/prendre quelqu'un, à chaque ""je vais juste là, j'en ai pour 5 min"", à chaque fois que quelqu'un n'as pas pelleté pour se parker et qu'on ne peut circuler dans la rue avec nos camions, à toutes les fois où un piéton ou cycliste qui marche dans la piste cyclable ou dans la rue et nous oblige de ralentir (et risquer de rester pris), aux nombreux ordures dans notre chemin qui nous empêchent de travailler, aux voitures qui doivent être remorquées, à chaque fois qu'il y a du trafic... et bien on doit arrêter les opérations.

On parle ici, dans Ville-Marie, de s'arrêter à peu près 1min à chaque 5 min. Imaginez si je passais dans votre bureau, devant votre écran, à toutes les 5 min pour vous empêcher de travailler... ALORS QUE ÇA ME MET EN DANGER, QUE JE N'AI RIEN À FAIRE DANS VOTRE BUREAU et que je vous blâme de ne pas penser à moi. Non seulement ça, mais je vous épargne les ""va chier"", ""c'est moi qui paye ton salaire"", ""bon un autre col-bleu qui se pogne le cul"", ""hey respecte ton client"" et ""get a real job"" qu'on vit à tous les jours. 

Vous allez croiser des appareils de déneigement, quoi?, 5 fois dans votre hiver... mais le gars dans l'appareil croise 5 personnes en 5 min. S'il commence à laisser passer tout le monde et s'arrêter chaque fois... la job ne se fera pas et c'est ceux qui le ralentissent qui vont chialer sur lui.

Un appareil de déneigement c'est potentiellement dangereux. Si vous ne donnez pas au moins 6 pieds de distance vous risquez de recevoir un morceau de glace (le bas des pelles est muni d'une lame de metal avec des ressorts pour amortir les chocs, et peut projeter des gros morceaux durs à 10-15 pieds) ou même de vous faire frapper s'il y a des surprises sous la neige ou dans la chaussée et que l'appareil dérape, ou une simple defaillance mécanique. Ça c'est sans compter ce qui peut arriver à ceux qui se mettent dans nos nombreux angles morts ou carrément entre la souffleuse et le camion qui se fait charger (vu à quelques reprises).

Donc s'il-vous-plaît, si vous voulez que tout aille mieux... donnez un petit 5-10min de coups de pelles pour bien dégager la rue quand vous vous stationnez, changez de bord de rue AVANT QUE L'APPAREIL SOIT RENDU SUR VOUS sur le trottoir, ne mettez pas vos ordures dans la bordée de neige qu'on va souffler et surtout quand vous voyez nos flashers oranges... NALLEZ PAS LÀ. Si chaque citoyen donne un 5 min pour ça, ça fait 10 millions de minutes de moins à déneiger pour les bleus.

Je suis conscient que ceux à qui je m'adresse sont sûrement trop focus sur leur petit nombril pour lire/comprendre ceci, ou bien juste fermés d'esprit, mais si j'ai éduqué au moins une personne ignorante ça aura été au moins ça de fait (et le ""vent"" fait du bien). J'ai sûrement oublier bien des détails, mais ça résume bien la situation.

Je termine en vous souhaitant tous une bonne journée, et de pas trop être pris dans le trafic.",2025-02-19T04:24:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1it1hxt/lenfer_du_déneigement_vu_de_lopérateur/,

1ih2b45,We should continue buying Canadian regardless…,IWICTMP,:Dfl: Discussion,2672,0.96,234,"(FR Suit)

I know there’s a month pause on the tariff but I think this is the perfect time to shift our mindset for the long term into buying our local productions. Especially for groceries, Québec has enough local productions in our generic grocery stores or dépanneurs and it’s not hard at all to get most of your stuff made here in Québec or Canada. Also with booze!

And I am strongly hoping that inter-provincial trading barriers are reduced as per our best capacity in the coming months.

While there’s not a direct replacement for Disney Plus if you are a big fan of Marvel, at least we can maximize in categories that we are already pretty good at.

Buy Local/Quebecois/Canadian

// 

Je sais qu’il y a une pause d’un mois sur les tarifs, mais je pense que c’est le moment idéal pour changer notre mentalité à long terme et privilégier les productions locales. Surtout pour les épiceries, le Québec a suffisamment de productions locales dans nos épiceries génériques ou dépanneurs, et il n’est pas du tout difficile de se procurer la plupart de nos produits fabriqués ici, au Québec ou au Canada. Et c’est pareil pour l’alcool !

Je souhaite aussi vivement que les barrières commerciales interprovinciales soient réduites dans la mesure du possible dans les mois à venir.

Bien qu’il n’y ait pas de remplacement direct pour Disney Plus si vous êtes un grand fan de Marvel, au moins, nous pouvons maximiser dans les catégories où nous sommes déjà assez forts.

Achetez des produits locaux / québécois/ Canadiens.

(Edit: When I refer to South Asians, I am mostly referring to Indians.). 


As a South Asian woman, I want to speak openly about the recent complaints regarding the behavior of certain South Asian men at Jarry Park.

Let me be clear: you are not being racist for speaking up. The behavior many women are describing is, unfortunately, something that is far too common in South Asia. It is not surprising to me, and many South Asian women will tell you the same. The problem is real and it follows us here.

Many of these men believe they can get away with harassment because Canadian laws are “too soft” in their eyes. I’ve overheard conversations where they openly say things like this. There is a sense of entitlement and a lack of accountability that fuels this behavior.

I’ve personally had to deal with it myself. I reported a man to the police after he harassed me and still, he had the nerve to follow me again the very next day. That’s how bold some of them feel. That’s why I urge everyone: please report these incidents every time they happen. Only then will they start to understand that this kind of behavior has consequences.

I remember when I lived here 8 years ago, Jarry Park used to be my go-to spot whenever it was warm outside. It was a place where I felt safe, relaxed, and connected to the community. Sadly, I haven’t been back in years not because I don’t want to, but because of the pathetic and disturbing behavior of certain men who’ve taken over the space. Frankly speaking, they have ruined not just Jarry Park, but much of the surrounding Parc Extension area as well.

To all the women who are facing this: I’m truly sorry. You do not deserve this none of us do. But we must keep speaking up. This is how change starts.

Let’s hold them accountable. Enough is enough.

1bu17g0,Texan visits Montreal for the first time with zero expectations,serchafles,Articles/Opinions,2391,0.92,448,"Wow. Wow wow wow wow. Is Montreal the greatest city that nobody knows about? Is this the most underhyped, slept-on city? My friends and I certainly thought so

Background: I am 27 years old and getting married in 40 days. I have lived in Texas since I was 12 years old. I had zero plans for a bachelor party. As a matter of fact, I had told my friends I do not want to do ANYTHING! That is until I invited my Canadian friend to the wedding and he begged me to meet him in Montreal for a bachelor party. Me and 4 of my friends all bought non-refundable tickets to go to Montreal for the past weekend. Unfortunately, my Canadian friend's father passed away a few weeks ago and he no longer could meet us for the bachelor trip. A few days before the trip I had no desire to go. We had not planned anything and it felt like a chore. Only reason we went was that the tickets were non-refundable.

Our Airbnb was located on St-Denis street. Amazing location! First thing we did (After going to the SAQ and SQDC) was to go to '3 brothers brewery' and had some amazing beer. From there it was mostly walking around and hitting up different bars and talking to the locals. Most people were so nice and loved to share their knowledge of the city with us. We ended the first night by going to Casino Island (because we're all poker players) and on the way back home at 3 am we stopped at La banqui-something for late night poutines. When we were drunkenly walking home from the poutine place at 4 in the morning, we knew there was something special about this city.

The next day started with Schwartz. As a Texan I will say it was probably top 3 best beefs I have ever had. And then the Mont Royal hike started. We had no idea what it was but that we had to go there. This hike changed our lives. Walking down the side of the mountain all the way to the airbnb with a birds-eye view of the city was amongst the best hikes I have ever had. It was when we walked down the wooden stairs to the city and seeing the beautiful church there that everybody had realized we had found something special in Montreal. We had found the hidden gem. Because you never hear anybody in the states talk about Montreal. Yet it was the best city any of us had visited.

On our last day, it was our goal to party. We hit up bars clubs and a strip club. I will keep this part short but it was probably the best time any of us had. Pretty sure everybody fell in love with the strip club that night :D. Ended it at 4 am, drunk, smoking cigs and walking home through chinatown.

We also ate at l'express and  Ma Poule Mouillée. Both AMAZING.

I have traveled to MANY of the ""great cities"", both European and American. Never have I had as much fun as I did in Montreal. Never have I not wanted to leave a city after a 3-day crazy vacation. We were literally planning our next trip while sitting at the airport to go home. We will be back Montreal. Thank you for your generosity and your (mostly) kind people.

p.s sorry if this was hard to read. I have never written a review online. Not even a yelp review. That is how great this trip was. It made me want to write about it

Edit: wow I did not expect this post to blow up like this. I can not keep up with the comments anymore. Few thoughts:

I forgot to mention but we did go to the Playground at 3 am the second night and was there til 7 am. I could tell its a top tier Poker room from how clean it was and also the number of people there at 4 am. Next time I am in Montreal, the plan is to go there a lot more as it was very fruitful the one time.

We WILL be back in the summer. Only thing that is a hurdle is Airbnb prices. The same airbnb we stayed at last weekend is triple the price in summer. Hopefully I can do some research and find the perfect time for both affordability and summer-time fun.

I see mixed comments about whether we ate at the right places or not. I am open to suggestions for next time. For what its worth we all enjoyed everything we ate/drank.

Lastly, please do not take so literally the statement about ""No one knows about Montreal"". Of course people around the world know that this city exists. What I meant by that is the average person thinks of Vegas for a Bachelor party. Or when asked what is the greatest city they say something like New York or London or Paris or Rome. I have travelled to all those ""great"" cities and I loved Montreal way way way more. It is truly a hidden gem.

The atmosphere at the clinic was pretty calm. The teamwork was pretty amazing. We saw around 200 patients which ain’t that much.

My mother flew in to visit me.

On the morning of September 22nd, she collapsed in the old port with major heart failure. Any other place, and any other time, she would have died. But yesterday morning, you saved her. 

One of you started performing CPR before she even hit the ground.

One of you called 911.

Two of you sprinted to her car to get medical records and her bags.

Because of what you did, she was in a hospital bed within 20 minutes at the CHUM, receiving the best medical care I've personally ever experienced.

Because of you she survived without brain damage.

Recovery will be a long and uncertain road, but it's only possible because of you.

Everything happened so fast, we never got any of your names. More than anything, I wish I could show thanks and appreciation for what you did for us. Instantly, and selflessly, you sprung into action and saved a life without question, and you deserve to be lauded for this.

If you or anyone you know we're involved in saving my mother's life at Bonsecours and Champ de Mars, at 10:40am on September 22nd, please contact me or make yourself known. You're a hero, and I can't thank you enough.

2ducz5,How I got scammed and found the kijiji scammer thanks to Google Streetview,rafstar,,1812,0.98,463,"It all started with trying to find a replacement phone on Montreal’s classified section of Kijiji.  I was on the hunt for a brand new Samsung S5; I ended up finding one fairly priced (420$) and the individual selling it lived 10 minutes away from my house.  We ended up setting up a meeting and he agreed to sell me his BRAND NEW: ROGERS Samsung S5 for 400$. 


I’m somewhat tech savvy person and I’m fully aware of all these fake replicas and blacklisted IMEI numbers. I did my due diligence and asked him to send me his IMEI number over text message. The IMEI was clean and everything seemed to be in order… 


I ended up meeting him at 4:30pm in the West Island of Montreal; he was about 17 years old, had a red t-shirt and came on his yellow bike. He seemed like a nice young man and he was very respectful. I inspected the phone; everything looked new and I verified both IMEI on the box and the phone; they both matched. The smartphone even had the ROGERS bloatware; I put my SIM card in and everything worked flawlessly. I had no doubt that everything about the transaction was kosher. 


Then, everything started going downhill from here. Once I got home; I did a factory reset of the phone and got  “Invalid IMEI” message.  I did some research online and found out that he rooted the phone and replaced the IMEI on the user interface to match the one on the box. He obviously sold me a FAKE, which had no figure print sensor (It didn’t cross my mind to verify that feature). The box and accessories were original and the IMEI on the box was clean; but the phone itself wasn’t an original SAMSUNG S5.


I tried contacting the seller the same night but he wasn’t cooperative. After a few messages; he finally agreed to give me my money back; the next morning 8:30AM at the same location. That same night I did some investigation on the individual:  he deleted his kijiji ad and he used an online forwarding service for his phone number.
I started looking in Google street view to find the residential areas around where we meet up. And this is what I saw! The same kid on the bike going into his house! BUSTED! 

The next morning, I waited for him at the same location to get my money back like we both agreed.  As I expected, it was a NO Show. He ditched last minute and never showed nor did he answer my calls. . I knocked at the house from street view but no answer I decided to drive around the area trying to spot him or find something that would give me a lead. I had no luck and ended up leaving empty handed. BUT I DIDN’T GIVE UP YET!


Fast-forward 1 week, it was Sunday August 17 2014. I drove around the same area and spotted a car waiting in front of that house. I decided to keep my distances and keep an eye out. 15 min goes by and whom do I see…THAT SCUMBAGG walking towards his house with some grocery bags. I quickly get out of my car and confront him. He was VERY surprised to see me but he was very calm. I didn’t get physical but I was following him the whole time giving him his options. #1 he gives me my money back and we both go our separate ways or #2 I call the police and he gets in trouble. The scammer didn’t care and he had no intention to give me my money back. 


I followed him into a public bus (I guess he thought he could get away and I wasn’t going to follow him anymore).  So I’m in the bus with this scammer not far from me and the cops are on the way. 5 minutes into my bus ride; a cop van stops the entire bus. The cops come in and I pinpoint them to the scumbag.  I ended up getting my money back (which was his best option) and they arrested him for possession of stolen goods. His personal phone he had in his pockets was reported stolen.  


I consider myself lucky of finding this guy thanks to street view. Be very vigilant out there.

Cliff:
- Got scammed a fake phone on kijiji
- Scumbag playing games with me
- I end up finding him on street view 
- 1 week later, I see him on the street
- I get my money back
- Cops arrest him
- WIN!

Considering what's happening in the United States and how hostile it's becoming for non-US citizens living there with the frequent ICE raids, it does stand to reason that many international delegates may feel unsafe in the US even with their diplomatic status.

Also Montréal is the closest major city to New York City that's not in the United States. So it also makes sense from a logistical standpoint.

13ybb9h,"My father passed away last month. This post is about you, the people of Montreal",le_eddz,Articles/Opinions,1485,0.98,113,"(Long post)

I was awoken on a Thursday morning at 5 AM by “the” phone call. It was hard for me to believe cause my parents live in my home country faraway, and my father actually had called me a few hours prior (11 PM the night before). It was just a 52-second call to hear my voice. I thought he sounded better than before. Little did I know that he knew it was happening.

I knew it was going to be a long day. I had to book a flight, contact work, pick up a few things from storage, buy a suit for the funeral, put my cat somewhere, and get to the airport.

I’ve been in Canada for around 6 years and have been working from home since the pandemic. Before that, I used to walk / bike to the office, but I’ve moved a few times since then, so I recently got a car. I booked my flight online and had to get to my U-Haul storage room in Lachine, which involved me taking a couple of highways (A13 and A20). 

This was my first time driving on a weekday at 7 AM. My radio was on low volume, and traffic was moving slowly. Windows rolled down. Still in shock. The commute felt somehow... calming. Drivers all around me going to their work. Zero honks. People using turn signals. Just the sound of traffic moving. Everything was organized. I felt safe and warm, like everything was gonna be alright. No driver knows what the driver next to them is going through. I was sure no one around me was having a bad day like I was, but I still had that feeling of... unity. Like everyone somehow had my back.

I got my stuff from storage and then headed to CF Fairview mall. This was my first time going to a mall during opening hours on a weekday. I arrived at 9:45 AM but didn’t know that most stores don’t open until 10 AM. I found a bench to sit on in the middle of the mall and just gathered my thoughts. A lady was sitting on the other end. There was calm music playing. Employees were rolling their store gates as opening hours were approaching. It was just hard to believe what was happening, but seeing people going about their days felt very heartwarming. 

I went to a formal-wear store and explained the situation to the employee and he gladly helped me find a good suit for my father’s funeral. He was patient and made sure I got what I needed. It took an hour, which I don’t know is considered short or long for buying a suit. I normally hate the process of buying clothes and trying them on, but this 1 hour felt like 5 minutes. I didn’t want it to end. I felt that once I bought this suit, it’s official, you know? I didn’t want to leave. The store employees were too nice and understanding. They wished me safe travels. I left the mall and had to finish my remaining tasks. My friend offered to keep my cat with her until I’ll come back.

I got to YUL around 3-4 hours before my flight. Check-in process was smooth. Everyone was just nice. I arrived at the gate and sat down. I decided to do some crossword puzzles instead of use my phone which was vibrating every few minutes. Just sitting there, with all those people walking around, smiling, laughing, talking on their phones... it just made me think “Life will go on. You will get through this. Everyone around you will have moments like these in their lives. It just so happens that it happened to you today. You will remember and cherish all the nice moments you had with him. Focus on doing what’s right and what he would’ve wanted you to do. Be there for him.”

Montreal was my dad’s favorite city. I’m very happy that I was able to bring my parents for a visit for a few months in 2021. He was so happy here. We’ve been trying for years to get their papers to move here, but had no luck. He actually also visited Montreal for a few months before I was born. It was his dream to live here. I’m just glad that I got to see him enjoy his time here during his visit. That was the last time I saw him in person.

I apologize for the long post. I just wanted to say that I’m happy that I’m in Montreal, and I’m thankful to have you around me. I don’t know many people here, but I know that I’m surrounded by kind, loving, and supportive people in this city. I love you all. Take care of yourselves and have a nice day.

EDIT:

Thank you everyone for your kind words. They mean a lot.

My father was 64 years old, not young but not too old.

He loved taking the STM metro and memorized Montreal street names better than I ever did. 

I never asked him which restaurant was his favorite, but I'd say it was 'Bistro Tôt Ou Tard' in Plateau.

He'd often go on 2-3 hour walks by himself in the city.

Much love for Montreal <3",2023-06-02T08:26:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/13ybb9h/my_father_passed_away_last_month_this_post_is/,

1loyu4x,Thank you kind stranger at biodome,IndecisiveTadpole,:Tfl: Tourisme,1483,0.99,38,"My husband and I are visiting from Toronto and this is our first family trip with our baby. We went to the biodome yesterday and my husband accidentally left his credit card inside the slot of the parking meter. When he realized his card was missing, he ran back to the parking meter but his card was gone. He was then on the phone with TD's customer service to lock his credit card.

After being bounced around to different reps on the phone, we were finally told by TD that the person who found my husband's credit card not only dropped it off at the lost and found, but they also called TD to let them know to lock the card. So the TD reps were able to connect my husband to the staff at the biodome who had his card and my husband got his card back! This all happened within the span of 40 minutes. 

I know it wouldn't have been the end of the world if he did have to lock his credit card and get a new one. But the fact that someone took time out of their day to call the bank and ask them to lock it reminded me that there are good people and quiet heroes everywhere. So thank you to the Good Samaritan for your act of kindness. We will find a way to pay this forward.

I'm visiting from Virigina, USA, and I have to say that this weekend has been one of the best I've had in my life. After bar-hopping Saturday night, the people are super friendly and so much more approachable than any city I've been to in America. There isnt trash everywhere, the roads are so much nicer, there's flowers in the CITY here?!?! Amazing! Nighttime, so much less worried about robbery than in the USA.

I wish we had our shit together over down south, where we could have cities just as consistently clean and beautiful. My friends and I are hoping for a more intelligent America in our lifetimes.

The Jazz festival was happening and I was able to visit it as well. Very cool! Any suggestions on places to stop around here during my visit?

I just wanted to share my appreciation for the wonderful time I've had here. I can wait to visit my work buddies and see the people I've been working with in the next few weeks and get to see more of what Quebec has to offer. Cheers friends!

txltj9,unpopular opinion - The recent threads about the homeless in the metro are tone death.,davou,MTL Talks,1385,0.79,572,"Homelessness is a massive fucking social problem -- People who have homes are currently struggling to make enough money to buy cereal. People who are homeless and jobless face the current economic conditions, except they are at the very bottom of the totem pole. This city is rapidly turning into a place where someone who works 40 hours isn't guaranteed to be able to make a living.

They face the literal possibility of freezing to death in the winter, and people are complaining that they're present in the metro. This city can kill you when it gets cold when it gets hot, and frankly its starting to be a place where you can be shot if you decided to go out when the weather was nice and you were unlucky.

They go hungry, are exposed to violence, they're disallowed in commercial spaces even when they manage to scrape together enough money to buy something, are judged by everyone (even here on Reddit), have no realistic access to healthcare, suffer from social isolation and are a constant threat of unprovoked violence.

The metro is just about the only place where they aren't deemed criminals just for trying to exist.

There are absolutely scary homeless people around! I've been panhandled at by someone in Atwater who was ACTIVELY peeing in a garbage can -- One hand asking for change, the other fully watering the stairs.

I agree that something should be done.

What grosses me out is that the majority of people calling for 'something' seem to think that the appropriate 'something to do' is to move them away from spaces you use. Well, I'm very sorry, but I don't fucking agree. There is literally NOWHERE for these people.

Shelters for the homeless can be very fucking weird places (and there are barely any of them). Historically they can be religious horror shows. Sometimes shelters are placed such that the only way to make use of them is for the homeless people to go so far out of town that they loose access to what little food/healthcare/social they have. 

Worse still are the complaints that the police don't do anything about it. This is actually what made me write this rant! Why the fuck would ANYONE who has access to this forum imply that the police should handle anyone in a position of vulnerability? We have videos of our police stomping on folks in the metro. We have video evidence of Canadian police pretending to be protestors and inciting violence. We are literally dealing with Canadian police threatening to walk off the job if we make them stop wearing racist iconography this very fucking second.

Lamenting that the police aren't doing something when someone smokes weed in the metro is admitting that you're okay with the possibility of someone being beaten by thugs, and potentially shot if they're fool enough to defend themselves.

If you have an issue with the presence of homeless people in Montreal, the ethical thing to do is either shut your fucking mouth or donate your time or money to help fix a problem that none of our Canadian peers should have to deal with (and I'm not talking about how unpleasant they made your wait for the train).

1k84hr3,Can we stop taking pics of the homeless and sharing/shaming them in this sub?,AuroraWolf101,:ReddIcon: r/montreal,1382,0.84,376,"It’s honestly gross when people take pics of homeless people and shame them. I’ve seen some truly vile comments under those photos. You all should be ashamed.

These are human beings. Humans who are having a very hard time. Most of them have a disability of some sort (disability includes mental illnesses and neurodiversity and a variety of things).

We are living in the middle of a housing crisis. A job crisis. Insane inflation that just won’t stop. Social services are being cut. Shelters are not necessarily accessible. A lot of homeless people also had camps until recently, but the police decided to raid and destroy a lot of them. So of COURSE they’re hanging out in the metro. There’s nowhere else to go for some of them!

There’s just a lot of shit going on right now making it really difficult for many people to live (and guess what? There’s about to be more). And you know what else? Most of us are one or two accidents away from being homeless yourselves. We’re all closer to being homeless than to being rich, that’s for sure!

12ldk36,An Anglophone's No-nonsense Guide to Practising French in Montréal,dat007,MTL jase,1357,0.97,157,"You  did it. You packed your bags and you finally left Mississauga, or  Missouri, or wherever, and you made it to beautiful Montréal. It's all  sunshine and bagels from here on out, right? Wrong. There is one  problem. It turns out you’re middle school french class wasn’t as useful  as you thought. Now you realize you can’t understand what the well  dressed, scarf-wearing pastis drinkers in Parc Laurier are saying and  you don't know why everyone is mad at Mathieu Bock-Cote. I know, I’ve  been there.

To truly experience  Montréal you know you need to brush up on your french. Unfortunately,  your anglo accent is noticeable the second you walk out of your 3 1/2  and every barista you meet responds in english when you try to order  your oat milk latte and everyone at your IT job speaks english too.

So,  in the spirit of anglo solidarity (I can hear the Gazette editors  sliding into my dm’s already, it’s a joke), I've put together an  anglophone’s no-nonsense guide to practising french in Montréal:

**1. Get a girlfriend**

Or  a boyfriend, or a theyfriend, whatever. Just figure it out and make  sure their francophone. Nothing will improve your french like a little  pillow talk. You’ll be whispering sweet nothings en français in no time.  Or, you’ll learn all the phrases necessary to make sure your new  squeeze knows she needs to rinse the plates before she puts them in the  dishwasher (I speak from experience)

Warning: it’s unlikely a lot of this vocabulary will translate to your professional life.

**2. Consider a kafkaesque adventure in québécois bureaucracy**

If  you’re used to the average Montrealer switching to english when you ask  for directions, you’ll be pleasantly surprised when dealing with the Qu**é**bec  public service. I highly recommend a low stakes bureaucratic nightmare  to really sharpen your french. Between all the phone calls, paperwork,  web-site visits and appointments, you’ll be sure to take your french to  the next level.

Some potential  options: fight a parking ticket, switch your foreign drivers license for  a Quebec one, or try to get a doctor appointment. That's about a month  worth of francisation classes right there.

**3. Straight up lie**

Whats  the big deal? You did it when you entered your height on your tinder  profile. You could opt for the «J'aimerais pratiquer mon français, s'il  vous plaît » that might work, but the cats already out the bag. If you  really want to practise, just pretend you don't speak english. There  aren’t too many Slovakians in Montreal, if anyone asks, you’re from  Bratslava.

**4. Old people**

Forget  practising with the youth. With their tiktok dances, their vapes, and  their new Harry Styles albums, their english is already better than  yours. If you are serious about practising your French and learning some  real Québécois slang, I recommend striking up a conversation with the  cute elderly couple. They’ll be more than happy to talk about their most  recent trip to Florida and they couldn’t care less about your silly  anglo accent.

Don’t forget to call your own mom too while your at it. You aren’t that busy.

**5. Stay out of downtown**

I  get it. There’s a Krispy Kreme. It's hard to avoid. But if you really  want to immerse yourself, you’re not going to do it west of St-Laurent.

**6. Drink more**

There  aren’t many situations where I’d recommend increasing your alcohol  intake. But, work Christmas parties, break ups, and, yes, french  conversation all benefit from copious liquor consumption. Take the green  line to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, pull up a stool, get a nice cold pint of  Tremblay and complain about the potholes. You’ll be fluent in not time.

So  there you have it. A tried-and-true, fool proof guide to practising  french in Montréal. Of course, you could always go the traditional  route. Sign up for a French class, buy a grammar book, do some  conjugation exercises, if you’re into that… you nerd. I'd however  recommend saving the boring stuff for the winter months.",2023-04-13T20:46:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/12ldk36/an_anglophones_nononsense_guide_to_practising/,

I’m not risking getting into an accident for you.

However this is not my problem get help before you hurt yourself or worse hurt someone else because you can’t control your emotions on the road. You might be running late for something, but I don’t give a flying fuck manage your time better its still not an excuse to act recklessly on the roads.

I started to get overwhelmed/overstimulated, so I started trying to get out of there. However, there were a lot of people, and it was difficult for me to navigate through the crowd. I noticed a man in front of me trying to get out as well, so I started to follow his path behind him. He saw me struggling and offered me his hand. He escorted me out of the crowd and I thanked him profusely. 

I didn't get the chance to get his contact info, and I'm sad I didn't, because I found him really cute!!

I am visiting from Vermont with my wife, and I have to say the generosity of the people of Montreal is incredible.

We were walking on Crescent street which was recommended to us by another friend and decided to stop by at the University library to use the bathroom.

Lo and behold, my wife spotted a free pad thai. Does this happen often in Montreal that people leave delicious food around?

1hupzs6,Je suis tanné,hungryplane_,:Dfl: Discussion,1292,0.92,316,"Salut la gang, bon pour vous faire ça short and sweet, je suis tanné.

Je suis né au Québec, à Montréal, tout comme plusieurs d’entre vous, cependant depuis la Covid, je ne me sens plus chez moi.

Je suis d’origine sud-asiatique (pas Indien, mais proche) et j’ai des cheveux bouclés. Alors oui, le monde ont toujours essayé, en vain, de deviner d’où je viens haha. Mais ces temps-ci, je trouve que le monde, mon monde, le genre de monde avec qui j’ai grandi, me méprise et me considère tout petit, comme un autre nouveau immigrant qui ne sait pas parler notre belle langue française et qui ne sait pas s’intégrer dans notre société.

C’est peut-être moi qui vire fou, mais le nombre de fois qu’on me regarde croche ou qu’on me regarde avec les yeux qui veulent dire “*sti encore un autre” ne cesse d’augmenter et ça me fait de la peine. La réalité d’un Québécois racisé est qu’à première vue, oui on te prendra pour un étranger, car tsé on parle pas avec tous les inconnus qu’on croise dans la rue et donc plusieurs assumeront toujours que je suis qu’un autre nouveau qui fait aucun effort pour bien s’intégrer.

Je dis ça parce que ça commence à affecter mon quotidien, surtout à cause de tous les trucs négatifs qu’on voit depuis un certain temps à propos des nouveaux arrivants. Ma ville, mon Québec et mon pays ont changé, mais je trouve que certains de ces changements là nous affectent négativement. Aye ça me fait rire le nombre de fois qu’on assume que je ne parle pas français dans les magasins, épiceries, restos, etc. et qu’on me parle directement en anglais.

Mes parents ont toujours valorisé la société qui leur a accueilli à bras ouverts. Mon ‘pa travaillait comme un malade dans un resto italien et il allait à ses cours de français, ma maman aussi. Ils ont bien apprécié la différence qu’offrait le Québec contrairement à l’Ontario et malgré que j’aie l’éligibilité d’aller étudier dans des écoles primaires et secondaires anglophones, ils ont fait le choix de m’envoyer aux écoles publiques francophones.

Malheureusement malgré tout cela, je suis déçu que pour certains, on restera toujours que des “immigrés”, rien de plus, rien de moins et j’haïs ça. Ça me donne envie de partir pour de bon et trouver un autre pays où je me sentirais chez moi.

Anyway, bonne semaine à vous tous :)

PS: Sorry I couldn’t write this in English, I’m tired and this is just a late night vent, but TLDR: I’m a Montrealer, born and bred, from South Asian parents and I’m tired of not feeling like I’m home and not being respected by my people.

Je les ai vus de mon balcon rentrer avec balais et vadrouille pour le gros ménage. Partir un peu plus tard et revenir avec l’énorme première épicerie d’appartement!

J’aime ça. J’aime ça voir les étudiant(e)s revenir en grand nombre à la fin de l’été. J’aime ça voir des jeunes qui découvrent la vie en appartement. Ça me rappelle quand je suis arrivé à Sherbrooke pour la première fois, quand j’ai été lancé dans la vie d’adulte sans petites roues!

La Well va se mettre à vibrer... Le temps de la rentrée au moins! Surement jusqu’aux intras. Les cafés vont se remplir, les terrasses aussi. J’aime ça un centre-ville animé. Après, ça se calmera évidemment, mais c’est correct. J’hais pas que ça dure juste un temps.

Ça va faire du bruit. C’est même assuré que ça va me déranger un peu. Je vais trouver certains comportements stupides, genre : « pourquoi il gueule en pleine rue celui-là? » ou encore, « c’est donc ben niaiseux leur défi d’intégration cette année ». Les boom-boom du show de la rentrée vont rentrer par mes fenêtres pis m’empêcher de dormir. C'est ça ou fermer mes fenêtres pis avoir trop chaud... maudite marde.

Mais au final j’aime ça pareil. Je suis content (un peu fier même?) que Sherbrooke soit une aussi belle place pour faire ses premières armes loin de ses parents. J’aime l’énergie que les étudiants apportent. J’aime les chocs que ça crée. Ça empêche de s’encrasser dans notre confort, ça apporte de nouvelles idées, ça permet à des bars d’exister et d’accueillir plein d’événements intéressants ou de spectacles à découvrir.

Faque c’est ça, le retour des étudiant(e)s commence pis ça me rend heureux.

zgjfwv,Cancellez Le Snack Poutines SVP.,King-Harvest,,111,0.97,50,"Je vous parle en tant que livreur Uber Eats. Ce soir, j'ai eu une (autre) mésaventure avec Le Snack Poutines.

Nous sommes à l'heure de pointe, 17h30 sur Wellington. C'est déjà difficile d'accès. J'avais accepté une commande peu payante du Snack. Peu de temps après, toujours en chemin vers le resto, je reçois une double commande bien payante, ce qui porte le total à trois commandes au total. Si je comprends bien le système, quand je les reçois, c'est que le resto les a acceptées aussi.

Au moment où j'arrive, l'un des messieurs qui travaillent là sort et me demande d'annuler mes deux autres commandes. La raison : elles ne sont pas prêtes et la première est prête. Ils ne pensent pas pouvoir faire les deux autres dans un délais raisonnable. Moi, je suis prêt à attendre, car la paye est conséquente pour de l'attente.

Les gens doivent savoir que lorsque les livreurs annulent une commande, ils sont pénalisés. Nous avons un ""cancellation rate"" et bizarrement, quand il n'est pas à zéro, on peut attendre longtemps avant de recevoir des commandes.

Environ 15 minutes passent et je reçois les deux autres commandes. Elles sont froides. Elles étaient prêtes depuis déjà longtemps. Je suspecte qu'ils m'ont fait attendre pour rien en espérant que j'annule.

Peu de temps après, je reçois une notice d'Uber Eats. Le restaurant a pris son privilège d'accorder des mauvais ratings aux trois commandes. Ça aussi, les ratings, c'est important pour l'algorithme qui distribue les commandes. Comme j'étais à 100%, ça m'abaisse à 97%. Ce n'est rien, vous dites? À 85%, Uber nous retire notre droit de livrer. Et comme ce resto veut clairement que je perde mon titre de livreur, si je fais d'autres livraisons pour eux, je risque de baisser encore et encore. En 12 livraisons pour eux, ils pourraient techniquement me faire perdre mon emploi.

Ça, c'est pour moi. On s'en sacre un peu : je fais ça à temps perdu. Ce n'est pas la fin du monde. 

Le problème, c'est leur comportement abusif en général avec les livreurs. À plusieurs reprises, j'ai vu deux des employés abuser verbalement d'autres livreurs, les traiter d'imbéciles, d'idiots, de tous les noms. Ils ne font pas ça à moi car je suis francophone, plus grand et plus gros, et que je peux leur répondre. Mais souvent, les livreurs ne comprennent pas à moitié l'abus qu'ils reçoivent et ne font que partir dépités en ne comprennant pas trop ce qu'il vient de se produire. Il m'est arrivé d'avoir des discussions avec d'autres livreurs et n'ont *TOUS* rapportés avoir vécu de l'abus de la part du Snack Poutines. La majorité des livreurs sont de nouveaux arrivants qui sont démunis de moyens de se défendre dans de telles situations.

S'il vous plait. Commandez ailleurs. Et quand il n'y a pas de problèmes avec votre livraison, donnez un bon rating. Ça aide à compenser les marchands en powertrip dans le genre du Snack.

Edit : Je vais vous donner des alternatives avec des poutines encore meilleures.
- Cantine O'Ptit Creux
- Louis' Luncheonette
- Bistro Belvédère

N'importe quoi sauf du maudit Snack overpriced.

Je tiens aussi à souligner qu'il y a un cuisinier qui vient parfois donner/prendre les commandes et qui n'a aucun comportement problématique avec les livreurs et les clients. Ce n'est pas tout le staff, mais ceux qu'on voit le plus souvent sont des connards.",2022-12-08T20:52:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sherbrooke/comments/zgjfwv/cancellez_le_snack_poutines_svp/,

NON, il n'y a pas de chemtrails, OUI la terre est ronde, tout n'est pas une conspiration et selon moi, y a beaucoup plus de chaos que de réelles conspis. Mais le chaos, c'est vague et les gens s'accrochent aux conspis pour avoir l'impression de comprendre ""the game"".

1o3tp3m,ATTENTION! Atlas / Appartements Bellevue,Striking-Ad1380,,50,1.0,17,"Ce post est une dénonciation contre Appartements Bellevue / Atlas Immobilier  : 
Nous avons vécu 6 mois dans un des appartements du 900 Rue Bertrand et ça s’est avéré a 6 mois de pur cauchemar. 
Voici la liste des problèmes rencontrés;
-1ere semaine après l’emménagement, je prends ma douche tranquille chez moi, j’etais seule, les portes barrées. J’entends des voix d’hommes crier pour savoir s’il y avait quelqu’un et reminder, j’etais seule, nue, dans la douche. Il a fallu que je m’obstine assez longtemps pour qu’ils sortent. Ils disaient qui avait urgence dans la salle de bain mais il n’avait RIEN. Je leur ai dit de me donner 15 min et j’allais etre sorti mais qu’ils sortent sinon j’allais appeler la police. Leur reponse? “Depeche jte donne 2 minutes pis apres ca on revient on a pas le temps de niaiser” L’urgence? Le robinet de la voisine d’en haut DEGOUTAIT… mais ca olivier, 99% du temps si tu l’appelles il fait juste crier et te raccrocher au nez. 
-tuyauterie fendu qui a causer un degat d’eau dans une des chambres secondes, refus d’aider, il nous a littéralement dit de nous arranger tout seul, alors il a fallu se retourner avec nos propres moyens. On a ouvert le mur car tout etait detremper et suivant l’urgence on a l’a appeler pour savoir ou etait la valve d’urgence car on etait sur le point de se retrouver les 2 pieds dans l’eau d’une minute a l’autre. Sa reponse? Vous aviez pas a ouvrir le mur. (monsieur tu nous a dit de s’arranger tout seul et on etait sur le point d’etre innondé à cause de TA batisse). Ca leur a pris 1 mois et demi et une mise en demeure pour revenir fermer le mur et le plafond. Pas d’assechement adequat, pas d’equipements fourni, pas de verification des planchers pour presence de moisissure et ils ont remis du platre par dessus de la moisissure deja existante.
-presence excessive de moisissure dans la salle de bain malgré l’utilisation d’un déshumidificateur (ecoure chie moi pourquoi mais d’apres moi ye en amour avec les déshumidificateurs, c’etait sa reponse à absolument TOUT). Il refusait d’installer une fan il y en avait tellement que ca commencait a manger les murs. 
-Les fenetres etaient pourries, l’eau s’infiltrait pendant les pluies.
-les portes et leurs isolations etaient tellement mal fait qu’on pouvait bien voir dehors a travers les cracks. Resultat? Pseudoscorpions, mille pattes, perces oreilles et on a du faire face a un infestation d’une centaine d’araignées dans la chambre des maitres qu’on a du traiter nous meme. 
-plusieurs point d’infiltrations d’eau dans la salle de bain. J’y ai mentionné depuis la premiere semaine que c’etait a reparer et que ca allait finir par lacher pis résultat? Ca a laché une semaine avant qu’on parte. 
-Notre cessation de bail se terminait le 30 juin 2025 on l’a achaler 4 mois pour signer un bail officiel et il l’ignorait completement mais par exemple y a pas eu de misere a confirmer l’augmentation du 1er juillet. 
-les portes d’armoires de la cuisine etaient toutes mangées du aux avant dernier locataires et leur chien et elles commencaient a moisir a cause de l’eau et l’humidité. Il refusait des changers parce qu’il disait que c’était esthétique. 
La liste peut aller encore mais je crois que ce que je viens de couvrir est assez! 
Atlas Immobilier est une entreprise sketch, sans adresse officiel dans le registre des entreprises (adresse dans un bloc appartement). Il a meme charger 150$ au locataire precedent pour qu’il puisse faire un enquête de crédit sur nous et il en a meme pas fait. Il nous a seulement demander noms, numero de telephone et qu’est ce qu’on faisait comme travail. 
Bref, ne faites jamais affaire avec eux . au moment de visiter notre nouvel appart on avait 2 lettres en mains. Soit l’abandon, soit la demande au tribunal. 
On etait aussi a la recherche de personnes qui aurait eu des mauvaises expériences avec eux dans le passé si on allait au tribunal et ca tient encore. On a un bon dossier mais si il decide d’aller de l’avant avec le tribunal ca serait bon d’avoir quelques témoignages en surplus 🫶🏼",2025-10-11T07:54:35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o3tp3m,

Je regardais les booster de cartes Pokémon et il m’a demandé quel était le meilleur d’après moi. Il avait un coat de l’université Bishop, alors je présume que c’est un étudiant, et aussi il parlait juste anglais(peut être étudiant étranger). Il était avec un homme, qui devait être probablement l’homme chez lequel il vie pour étudie ici. Le monsieur parlait français et anglais lui, il disait aussi qu’il fumait le cigar. Bref, le garçon devait faire environ 5""7 et il aurait 21 ans. Il avait les cheveux bruns ébouriffés et des yeux bruns aussi. J’ai payer mes booster et en partant je lui ai juste offert un de ceux que j’avais acheter en lui disant bonne chance de pogner quelque chose de bon haha! Il était comme vraiment surpris et m’a dit merci et je suis sortie. Alors si quelqu’un a une idée de qui ce pourrait être, j’aimerais bien retrouver ce beau gars là !  : )

 Hello,I am writing this message because I am looking for a boy I saw at the Tabagie at the carrefour de l’estrie around 4:15 p.m march 7. I was looking at the Pokémon card boosters and he asked me which was the best in my opinion. He had a coat from Bishop University, so I assume he is a student, and also he only spoke English (maybe a exhange student). He was with a man, who must have probably been the man with whom he lives to study here. The man spoke French and English himself, and he was talking about smoking cigars. In short, the boy must have been about 5""7 and he would be 21 years old. I paid for my boosters and when I left I just offered him one of the ones I had bought by saying good luck to get something good haha! He was really surprised and said thank you and I went out. So if anyone has an idea of who it could be, I would like to find this handsome guy! : )",2025-03-08T07:46:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sherbrooke/comments/1j6gfe6/à_la_recherche_dune_personne/,

Salut tout le monde !

Je suis dans la trentaine, je parle anglais (langue maternelle) et j’ai un niveau intermédiaire en français. Je vis à Sherbrooke et je cherche à élargir mon cercle social tout en améliorant mon français (et je peux aider en anglais en échange !).

J’adore être dehors : que ce soit pour marcher, faire de la randonnée, courir ou faire du vélo. En ce moment, j’apprends aussi à nager 🏊🏽‍♀️. Je suis toujours partante pour essayer de nouvelles activités ou découvrir de nouveaux endroits.

Si tu es sympa, curieux·se, et que tu veux pratiquer une langue, échanger sur la vie, ou simplement partager un café ou une balade, écris-moi ! Je suis dispo surtout les soirs et les week-ends.

Et si tu n’es pas à Sherbrooke mais que tu es quand même intéressé·e, je suis aussi ouverte à faire connaissance en ligne pour échanger et discuter !

À bientôt peut-être ! 😊",2025-07-02T20:20:34,https://i.redd.it/3kfb8bnsyjaf1.jpeg,

A bit about me: I’m a mechanical engineering student, vegan, into running, lifting, D&D, and all things outdoorsy or nerdy. So I’d love to connect with people who share similar interests!

Here’s what I’m currently looking for:

A running or triathlon club I could join

A good (and affordable) gym in Sherbrooke

Any D&D groups or LARP communities that are open to new members

Or just any other cool stuff going on — events, game nights, hikes, local meetups, you name it!

Je suis parti pour aller travailler jeudi matin à 6h40 et je vois l'autre bord de la rue un gars noir portant seulement une pair de jeans (clairement itinérant) en train de fouiller dans le bac du voisin d'en face et de tout crisser ses vidanges par terre. Il avait clairement l'air high et/ou en genre de psychose et se parlait seul. Je me suis arrête 30 secondes pour me demander si je devais intervenir, puis je me suis dit ""fuck off, pas le gout de dealer avec ça.""

Je reviens de la job en début d'après-midi et mon voisin (un autre voisin) vient me voir pour me dire que ses caméras ont spottées un gars noir quitter mon terrain avec un cable d'extension qui traine derrière lui pour se diriger vers le cabanon d'un autre voisin (pour voler plus de cables d'extension j'imagine). Ça me fait un peu capoter que ce gars là soit venu se promener sur mon terrain pendant que je sois pas là et pendant que ma blonde dorme encore, mais je vérifie toutes mes choses à l'extérieur et rien n'est manquant. Je dors sur mes deux oreilles et fait de beaux rêves.

Aujourd'hui j'arrive pour étendre mon linge sur la corde, et je peux pas parce qu'il N'Y A PLUS DE CORDE À LINGE. (Bon, pas vraiment en fait. C'est juste une corde en nylon qui permet de faire monter et descendre ma corde à linge pour pas que je m'étrangle quand je marche dans ma cours. Mais là la corde est trop haute donc je peux pas m'en servir)

Le p'tit bum. C'est peut-être le karma pour pas lui avoir dit de decalisser quand il fouillait dans les vidandes de mon voisin.

I am a queer Non-Binary Anglo thinking of moving to Sherbrooke, and I wanna know if this is a good idea or not. I've been living in Montreal for 6 years, and my French is not great (B1 written/A2 spoken). I live in a fairly Francophone neighbourhood right now, and can get by with day-to-day tasks, but definitely don't know enough to do anything more complicated, hold a lengthy conversation, or do any job that requires customer service. I have 10 years of kitchen experience, so I think I could probably find a job in a restaurant or bar somewhere with some ease once things reopen.

Question 1: How queer-friendly is the city? Will I have to worry about how I dress and present in public?

Question 2: I have chronic health conditions that need supervision. How hard will it be to find an English-speaking family doctor or access healthcare in English? (I have had surprising difficulty with this in Montreal, I had a broken bone once and one hospital emergency room here straight up denied to admit me unless I started to speak in French)

Comme la plupart d’entre vous, j’ai vu au cours des dernières années le cout du logement exploser. Malgré la gravité de la situation, je dois dire que j’ai trouvé un franc manque d’imagination quand il venait à discuter de solutions, ce qui m’a poussé à rechercher des modèles alternatifs à notre dichotomie de locataire et propriétaire. 

J’ai résumé mes recherches dans un court document de trois pages, et j’aimerais le partager avec vous pour entamer une vraie discussion autour de solutions concrètes développées au niveau local. Non, je ne crois pas qu’on puisse transposer directement aucune de ces solutions ici et s’attendre à tout résoudre demain. Mais en si on s’en inspire, on peut développer notre propre modèle qui priorise les citoyens et leurs besoins.

Sur ce, je vous encourage à lire, partager, et faire vos propres recherches. N’hésitez pas à me contacter pour en discuter, j’adore le feedback!

Bonne lecture

*Like most of you, I saw the cost of housing explode over the last few years. Despite how bad the situation is, I found that people were tragically unimaginative when it came to discussing actual solutions, which led me to research some alternative models to our renter/landlord/owner status quo.*

*I summarized my research in a short 3-page document that I would like to share with you to start a real discussion around concrete solutions developed at a local level. To be clear, I do not believe any of these to be a silver bullet that we can simply bring over and expect to fix everything. But if we take inspiration from abroad, we can develop our own model that works for our citizens and their needs.*

*I thus encourage you to read, share, and do your own research. Do not to hesitate to contact me if you want to discuss the topic, I am looking for feedback.* 

*Happy reading*

I’m a 30-something queer geeky guy looking for things to do around town =]

i should note i do not drive so that probably limits some of my options, but I’m very open to trying new things! 

I do lots of walking (today i did 8km, the other day about 15km, which included lac des nations) and i love being in nature and parks, as well as exploring the city by foot. I plan to eventually get a bike (and maybe a bus pass) to make traveling easier. Im an artist, so i often bring my work/projects to parcs and cafés. I do mostly traditional art but ive been getting into digital art as well on my ipad, which is super convenient! I also want to dabble in photography to expand my repertoire, its great for inspiration and taking my own reference images for my art.

So far ive joined the gym, and had an art jam with some friends at torrefacteur géogène (something i want to host more regulary sjnce it was a one off)- im just looking for other things to do, places to go, people to meet, etc since im new to Sherbrooke. My spoken French is good enough to get by, and im not afraid of being put into unfamiliar situations ill just roll with the punches, faults and all!

ive been wanting to get into things like Kayaking, Hiking, fishing, etc, but im not sure where to start! bouldering and rock climbing seem interesting, too, but im not sure if my body is ready for that yet ;*)

I like metal and punk music so ive been wanting to see a show at le Murdoch, im open to all kinds of music though, any other metal heads or punks here? or people into ambient, idm, experimental music, etc?

also down with geeky shit, like playing D&D, magic the gathering, boardgames,smash bros, mariokart, etc - are ther any people here down for that sort of thing, or groups? you can go play magic casually at the griffon right? do they have D&D as well? and if so is it possibly bilingual?

are there any private art ateliers in sherbrooke? id love to seriously level up my skills, i know uni de Sherby and Bishops have fine art programs, but i already have a background in that as well as illustration and concept art! one thing ive always wanted to do was album art for like local death and black meta bands, grindcore, punk, noise rock, experimental music, etc

im a huge horror fan too.

down for volunteering, art therapy or just making new friends as well, if anyone shares some of these interests!



anyways merci beaucoup pour votre temps

1m5sblx,"Jeu de rôle à Sherbrooke, recherche de joueurs/joueuses",AdrianHBlack,,15,0.9,9,"Salut !

Relativement nouveau à Sherbrooke, j'aimerais me trouver un petit groupe de joueurs/joueuses pour faire des one shots et des campagnes +/- courtes. J'ai déjà posté sur le groupe Facebook du Club de jeux de sociétés et de jeux de rôle de l'université, mais on sait jamais si ça tente des gens par ici :P

Pour le premier one shot que je propose, j'aimerais faire du Land of Eem.

Land of Eem est un jeu de fantasy post-apo inspiré en partie d'Adventure Time, avec des tons parfois épiques à la Seigneur des Anneaux, parfois comédiques à la Muppet, et avec une dose de post apo à la Mad Max.  
C'est un jeu qui cherche à promouvoir l'exploration, le roleplay et la créativité avant tout, avec des procédures de voyage, d'exploration, de campement, des donjons, un peu de magie et de craft, des quêtes en tout genre et un bestiaire haut en couleurs !
Le jeu reste facile d’accès, et est beaucoup moins complexe que D&D :P

Comme précisé plus haut c'est le premier jeu que je propose, hésitez pas à quand même m'écrire si d'autres types de jeux vous intéressent

Pour les détails maintenant :

* ce serait au campus principal
* de préférence on jouerait en soirée en semaine
* pas spécialement de matériel nécessaire mais vous pouvez venir avec vos dés
* les fiches de personnages et le matériel sont en anglais, mais on jouera en français et je peux aider à traduire des choses
* pas besoin de connaître le jeu ou les règles
* c'est un one shot, aucun engagement autre ! Vous pourrez participer aux autres, ou juste à celui là sans problème

Hésitez pas à commenter ici ou à m'écrire en MP si ça vous tente, que ce soit pour ce one shot ou juste si vous voulez jouer IRL un moment donné, j'essaye de monter une table de manière générale et j'ai plein de jeux différents que je veux run ! :D",2025-07-21T15:23:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sherbrooke/comments/1m5sblx/jeu_de_rôle_à_sherbrooke_recherche_de/,

What are some must do’s in Sherbrooke? Museums? Attractions?

My friends back in Texas are asking me to bring back some hockey sweaters. I would like to surprise them with some deep cuts. Where would I go for some vintage sports gear or used jerseys?

I’m planning to move from Montreal. I’m an international graduate student and I’ve been in Montreal for around 5 years now. Since COVID, I’ve been working from home and the prices in Montreal are getting higher. Also, I wanted to be closer to nature and have a lot of recreation spots nearby. 

I’ve been looking at apartments in Trois Rivière and they seem within my budget. Just curious what your advice would be about the following:

1. Language: I can understand most spoken French but my speaking skills aren’t that great. Part of the reason I wanted to move was to be immersed in the language. Do you think there is avenue to meet people and get to actually learn the language ?

2. Activities: Considering COVID, is it still possible to get into recreational sports and other activities. Would language be a barrier here ? 

3. Social Life: Is it difficult to socialize in general? I’m in mid my mid to lateish twenties. Are there a lot of people in this age group.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",2021-04-11T00:31:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/troisrivieres/comments/mokbr3/moving_here_from_montreal_advice/,

Par exemple, elle était toujours d'attaque quand elle recevait le maire Lamarche à la radio, mais comment va-t-elle réagir quand c'est elle qui va se faire cuisinier ?
Bref, je l'aime bien et j'aimerais voir ce que ça donne une Catherine Gaudreault à la tête de la mairie.

xssh1t,Quoi faire quand la police ne vous aide pas ?,JosephCucked,,10,0.78,23,"*Svp je n'ai pas envie de lire votre opinion sur le systeme policier du Québec.*

Je veux juste savoir quoi faire.

Un harceleur n'arrête pas, je contacte la police mais ils me disent que c'est trop banal pour intervenir puisqu'il ne me fait pas de menaces verbales directement.

Mais ces comportements entrent tous dans la définition de harcèlement criminel selon Educaloi.

La police me dit de porter plainte au judiciaire ...

Mais le temps qu'ils agissent, s'ils le font, il sera trop tard. C'est rendu que mon harceleur surveille mon domicile avec ses amis.

Il est de plus en plus alaise, de plus en plus intrusif.

J'ai peur Christ. 
J'sais pas quoi faire, j'ai nul part où aller en plus.
Pas de famille/ami rien qui peut m'héberger.

Le Havre peut-être ? (Un centre d'hébergement temporaire)

Savez-vous c'est quoi le pire ? Je ne le connais même pas ! 

C'est un prédateur local qui m'a spottée pis qui ne me lâche pas. 

Sa gang de rue l'appel pathétiquement ""Jésus"" (c'est un osti de narcissique c'est certain pour se faire surnommer dememe). Je ne sais rien d'autre de lui.

Sérieux La petite Pologne est un secteur à haut risque criminel. J'vais devoir déménager au plus tabarnak.

Le commissaire à la déontologie policière ne m'aidera pas à les convaincre d'intervenir à temps.

J'sais pas quoi faire ... j'vais aller aux CAVAC (centre d'aide aux aux victimes d'acte criminel) j'imagine...

J'ai tout l'équipement et l'espace nécessaire pour brasser tout grain. J'aime bien varier les styles de bière, et idéalement je brasserais 2 fois par mois. 

C'est assez simple, je cherche quelqu'un qui est passionné par le brassage. Si on a des points en commun, encore mieux. 

Bref, laissez-moi savoir s'il y a des intéressés. Je cherche pas nécessairement une seule personne, on peut être 3 voire 4. Mon but est de brasser des batchs régulières (23L) et nous les diviser. Je veux aussi diviser le nettoyage des équipements et bouteilles, puis quelqu'un qui veut coopérer durant le brassage, puis être inventif. Je n'ai aucun problème à ce que vous soyez des débutants ou experts. Je veux juste des passionnés et des gens sérieux.

De ce que j'ai pu lire, nous ne pouvons demander directement une caution, mais concernant les locations meublées il y a encore un trouble dans la loi.

Ma question est: est-ce qu'il existe un moyen de se protéger de se genre de problèmes ? Ou est-il possible d'obtenir une caution ou autre qui pourrait couvrir la perte matérielle?

Depuis la fin du mois de septembre, je remarque que la piste cyclable est « fermée » au niveau de l’amphithéâtre. Je suppose que ça a un lien avec la préparation des Délices d’automnes qui se tiendra du 11 au 14 octobre prochain. Est-ce qu’il n’y a que moi qui trouve que ça n’a aucun bon sens que de priver l’accès aux citoyens au bord de l’eau pour…Ça?

Je veux dire ; est-ce qu’ils sont obligés de mettre de grandes barrières et ne laisser absolument aucun passage piéton/vélo? Personnellement j’ai fait fuck off et j’ai passé quand même, mais, pourquoi s’acharner pour faire chier les gens? 

J’ai fait une requête au 311 il y a deux semaines pour dénoncer cette situation, elle a été annulée le lendemain. Je trouve ça TRès ordinaire. Ce sont les dernières semaines avant l’arrivée du temps froid et je promène quotidiennement mon chien dans ce secteur, j’adorais voir le fleuve et l’autre rive, avec le coucher de soleil. 

À qui je pourrais signifier mon mécontentement dans l’espoir de faire changer les choses? Ou c’est peut-être juste moi qui capote pour un rien? Vos avis là-dessus?

Je suis une étudiante au bac en histoire et j'ai accepté une offre d'admission de l'UQAR - mais aussi d'ailleurs - et j'aimerais en savoir plus sur la ville et sur l'Université avant de prendre une décision finale. Ça m'aiderais énormément si quelques uns d'entre vous répondiez à certaines de mes questions.

1. Est-ce que c'est plus cher de vivre en résidence qu'en appartement avec des colocs? C'est quoi (à peu près) le coût du loyer d'une étudiante?
2. Est-ce que le campus est très petit ou très grand? Il y a (environ) combien d'étudiant.e.s? Comment est la culture à l'UQAR? Les gens foirent-ils souvent, est-ce que c'est plus tranquille, ou est-ce qu'il y a un peu des deux?
3. Je n'ai pas manqué le post sur les néo-nazis au Bas-St-Laurent ni les nouvelles sur les ados qui se battent. Est-ce que ces problèmes-là sont courants ou posent un risque aux gens d'ailleurs, aux femmes ou aux personnes LGBTQ+? Est-ce qu'on voit ça sur le campus de l'UQAR, ou plus dans les écoles ou les banlieues? Ma ville a moins de nazis mais autant de bagarres, si je ne me trompe pas, alors je demande plus pour m'assurer que *je* serai en sécurité/que je ne me ferai pas déranger.
4. Est-ce que les personnes LGBTQ+ sont bien traitées ici? Y a-t-il des associations ou des activités ou *n'importe quoi* par et pour les personnes LGBTQ+? Je sais que l'UQAR a mis ça en valeur sur leur site web, mais rien ne me dit que ce n'est pas pour se racheter d'un incident du passé. Les opinions des rimouskois.e.s LGBTQ+ me valent plus pour cette question, non pas que je veuille offenser les cishétéros du groupe.
5. Elle est comment, la culture à Rimouski? Est-ce que la communauté est très active ou plus tranquille? J'ai de la parenté brayonne et j'ai vécu à Frédéricton (qui, je pense, est *un peu* plus grand que Rimouski), est-ce que ça se compare à un ou l'autre de ces endroits?

Si vous avez lu jusqu'ici, je vous apprécie énormément! Je répondrai à vos commentaires autant que possible, mais sachez que je vous lirai tou.te.s.

Je mène un projet de recherche sur la régulation de l'estime de soi dans le contexte des relations interpersonnelles pour mon doctorat en psychologie à l'Université de Sherbrooke. Mon doctorat n’est malheureusement pas financé par un organisme subventionnaire, je dépends donc de la bonne volonté des gens pour mener à bien mon projet de thèse. 

*Bénéfices* : Participer vous fera **réfléchir à votre estime de soi** dans vos relations interpersonnelles et vous donne **accès à un résumé** **des résultats** lorsque l'étude sera terminée. 

*Comment* : Vous pouvez **participer** **seul.e** ou **avec un.e de vos proches** (comme un.e ami.e, un.e membre de votre famille, votre conjoint.e, etc.). La participation est **anonyme** et consiste à remplir des questionnaires **en ligne**.

2. J'ai consulté le plan des résidences et il ne semble pas y avoir de laveuse ni de sécheuse. Y a-t-il une salle de lavage commune dans les pavillons ?
3. Avons-nous la possibilité de verrouiller la porte de notre chambre pour éviter que nos colocataires ne fouillent dans nos affaires ?

• **100% levain naturel** (pas de levure commerciale ajoutée).  
• **Le moins d’ingrédients possible** (farine, eau, sel, levain – c’est tout !).  
• **100% farine intégrale ou bio** (pas de farine blanche raffinée).

Quel pain au levain vous aimez ?  
Pouvez-vous partager la liste des ingrédients, si vous l’avez ?

J’ai fait des recherches et j’ai trouvé **Le Farinographe**, **Les Baguettes en l’Air**, et **Folles Farines** au Bic.  
Peut-être avez-vous d’autres artisans cachés dans le coin ?

Merci pour vos recommandations ! 😊",2025-10-12T08:53:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rimouski/comments/1o4obcj/quel_est_le_meilleur_pain_au_levain_à_rimouski/,

Pas de stress pour les soirées achalandées, Losange et Narval sont déjà sécurisés pour le vendredi et samedi soir. Jveux les faire depuis leur ouverture, alors l’anticipation est là.

Pour le dimanche soir, on dirait que seul le Mange-Grenouille est ouvert dans Rimouski. Ou la cantine côtière qui fermerait à 19h, mais je suis pas certain de son horaire automnal. Sinon, j’envisageais peut-être le Ketch que je visiterai de toute façon pour récupérer des bières. Est-ce que j’ai manqué quelque chose?

Il me reste les midis, aprèm ou apéros. Je voulais essayer Le Bicois et avec les vins, également depuis leurs ouvertures, qui sont que fonctionnel pour l’apéro vu leur horaire. Si y’a un pop-up de Saison Déli, Projet Yaku, le Ravito ou encore des Jardins de Métis pour l’Action de Grâce, je serais preneur mais j’en ai pas trouvé.

Surement que les midis seront dédiés aux cantines, Sainte-Flavie (fermé pour la saison), celle de Colombe St-Pierre, etc. à moins qu’un lunch du vendredi aux Affamés soit un must. Je pensais aussi à aller bruncher le dimanche au projet La Ruche à Baie-des-Sables, si quelqu’un a du feedback à offrir. Je cherchais également un endroit où déguster les charcuteries de Florent, qui je présume seront au marché public le dimanche?

Merci

Édith: le menu d’octobre/novembre de Narval a de la charcut de Florent, Losange fait partie de la liste de distribution de Florent et en effet ils sont exposant au marché public.

J’ai découvert le vignoble de la FETE sur le site du marché aujourd’hui, quelqu’un y a goûté? Par rapport à la nordicité de Charlevoyou, Couchepagane, le Raku, le Feux follets ou encore Domaine Cap-aux-Oies, ça donne quoi?

1mukckt,J’ai travaillé pour la Ville de Laval : voici un aperçu de pourquoi tout ne peut pas être réparé immédiatement,Siikay,,99,0.95,31,"Vous êtes déjà passé devant une balançoire brisée, un lampadaire éteint ou un terrain de jeu endommagé en vous demandant : *“Pourquoi personne ne répare ça ?”*

J’ai remarqué plusieurs publications où la Ville est critiquée pour le manque de réparations et d’entretien. Je souhaite donc partager un aperçu de l’intérieur afin d’apporter un éclairage et de répondre à certaines de ces préoccupations.

J’ai travaillé derrière les coulisses de la Ville de Laval, et j’ai vu passer **des dizaines de milliers de bons de commande** liés à l’entretien et aux réparations. Mon dernier rapport analysé comptait à lui seul plus de **20 000 demandes**. C’est dire à quel point les besoins sont immenses et constants.

  
De l’intérieur, j’ai pu constater les vrais défis : délais de livraison interminables, manque de pièces, manque de main-d’œuvre, financement limité, et des élus dont l’implication varie beaucoup. Voici ce que chaque citoyen devrait savoir.

 

**1. Le signalement citoyen**

Bien souvent, les réparations ne sont tout simplement pas effectuées… parce que personne n’a signalé le problème. Il est crucial d’appeler le **311** et de décrire la réparation à faire. Ne présumez pas que quelqu’un d’autre l’a déjà fait ou que la Ville est au courant.

**2. Les pièces et le matériel**

Un des plus gros défis : le manque de pièces. Certaines doivent être commandées et peuvent prendre plusieurs mois avant d’arriver. La Ville fournit des efforts pour fabriquer ou bricoler certaines pièces elle-même dans ses ateliers, mais malheureusement, tout n’est pas possible.

**3. L’ampleur des demandes**

J’ai vu passer des dizaines de milliers de bons de commande pour l’entretien et la réparation des **parcs et espaces publics** : bibliothèques, casernes de pompiers, postes de police, centres communautaires, etc. Les besoins sont immenses et continus.

**4. Le manque de main-d’œuvre**

La Ville a besoin de plus de **cols bleus** pour répondre aux besoins d’une population qui ne cesse de croître. Le taux de croissance de la population dépasse largement celui des infrastructures et des services offerts. Et au risque de vous surprendre, la ville embauche en permanence, Allez-y, prenez une chance et déposez une demande d’emplois.

**5. Le rôle des élus**

Tous les élus n’ont pas la même approche. Certains travaillent de façon constante, année après année, pour s’assurer que leur secteur est bien entretenu. D’autres réagissent surtout lorsqu’un citoyen dépose une plainte dans leur bureau, et certains redoublent d’efforts seulement à l’approche des élections.  
C’est pourquoi, en tant que citoyens, nous devons voter pour des personnes réellement engagées envers la communauté **365 jours par année, 7 jours sur 7**, pas seulement lors des campagnes électorales.

**6. Le financement**

Derrière tout cela se trouve évidemment la question du **financement**. Le budget de la Ville détermine directement la capacité d’embaucher du personnel, d’acheter de l’équipement, d’entretenir les infrastructures et d’assurer la sécurité dans les espaces publics.  
Or, personne ne souhaite voir ses taxes augmenter, ce qui crée une pression énorme sur la gestion interne : chaque dollar doit être utilisé de manière optimale, et les priorités doivent constamment être réévaluées. Un dollar prévu pour remplacer une balançoire peut rapidement être redirigé vers la réparation d’un lampadaire de rue défectueux, ou encore vers une porte de caserne de pompiers bloquée qui empêche les camions d’urgence de sortir.

**7. La responsabilité citoyenne**

Enfin, chacun de nous a un rôle à jouer. Cela peut être aussi simple que **ne pas jeter un déchet par terre, en ramasser un**, utiliser les installations de façon adéquate (par exemple, ne pas abîmer les modules de jeux ou les bancs), respecter les consignes dans les bibliothèques et centres communautaires, ou encore signaler rapidement les bris au 311. De petits gestes quotidiens qui font une grande différence.

 

En comprenant mieux ces enjeux et en agissant chacun à notre niveau, on peut réellement améliorer la qualité de vie dans nos quartiers.  
Parce qu’au final, une ville en santé ne repose pas uniquement sur ses employés… mais aussi sur **nous, les citoyens**, et notre volonté d’agir ensemble.

Alors, la vraie question est simple : voulons-nous continuer à subir et se victimiser, ou voulons-nous, chacun à notre échelle, contribuer à une ville plus propre, mieux entretenue et plus vivante ?

J'ai aussi constaté qu'il y a beaucoup d'enfants qui utilisent leur vélo pour aller à l'école cette année, et beaucoup de personnes âgées avec des vélos à assistance électrique.

J'ai moi même commencé à utiliser mon vélo pour aller au travail et j'ai trouvé ça super. j'ai plus d'énergie et moins de stress.

1hlmvba,Review of the Laval Aquatic Complex AKA Bananaland,JanSolo,Discussion,50,0.92,6,"Hi Laval-ers!
I took the fam to the new Aquatic Complex between Centropolis and the Carrefour yesterday. Here's my review.  
Overall, very good. The facilities are clean and modern; everything is tidy and seemed in order. The yellow-and-cream colour scheme makes you feel like you're inside a giant banana. It's definitely unique; not complaining.  
The rec pool is definitely designed for learners; it's shallow enough where most kiddos will be able to stand comfortably and there's a lane area for more experienced learners. There's a small splashpad/pataugeoire, a waterslide and a basketball hoop with some polo balls. It's not WetNWild, but it's way better than any YMCA or other learning pool. Water temperature was welcomingly warm although I expect that to change once the bean-counters get involved. (Looking at you Aquadome LaSalle; brrr!).  
The competitive pool on the other side was super awesome. It's a full olympic sized (50m) pool with a movable barrier that can be used to split it into 2 smaller pools. Also, there's a movable floor so that they can set the depth (from 0 to 3m); I've never seen one of these before... very cool!  
They also have a 5m deep diving pool with lots of 1m and 3m boards that anyone can use. The taller 5, 7 and 10m diving tower is closed to the public and only opened for schools and clubs. My kids were disappointed; they wanted to try the 5m one.  
I'm not a big fan of the 'Amilia' booking system that you need to use to buy tickets and passes. It's not exactly user-friendly and the barcode scanner on the turnstyle to get in wasn't working when we went. However, it's only been a few days, we have to expect some niggles and minor issues.  
Overall, I really like it. Glad to see it's finally finished. It looks like the builders did a really good job; the facilities are modern and excellent. Just what Laval needed. Happy to see my tax dollars used for something worthwhile.  
Cheers.

He Blocked the way with his car...
He waited till a was ready to leave.

Young in his early 30's maximum.

1jkj7cc,"Attention à ""La Famille Québec Alimentation"" - Pratiques douteuses/arnaque de ""boîte découverte"" gratuite",Itchy_Complaints,Nouvelles,45,1.0,19,"Salut tout le monde,

Je veux vous mettre en garde contre une entreprise douteuse qui se promene maintenant à Laval sous le nom ""La Famille Québec Alimentation"". Ils se présentent comme une nouvelle boutique/boucherie locale qui veut se faire connaître en offrant une ""boîte découverte"" gratuite, mais c’est juste une façade. En réalité, ils opèrent depuis des années et leurs pratiques sont malhonnêtes.

Voici mon experience récente avec eux:

Ils vont de porte en porte pour cogner à votre porte, ensuite, ils vous offrent cette fameuse ""boîte découverte"" soi-disant ""gratuite"", mais il y a un piège. En échange, vous devez accepter qu’un vendeur vienne chez vous pendant 30 à 45 minutes pour vous faire un pitch de vente agressif (ils utilisent la méthode ""entenoir"", c'est à dire, vous donnent le moins d'information possible (prix, frais, etc)). Si vous refusez leur visite après avoir pris la boîte, ils vous facturent pour cette boîte ""gratuite"" selon le contrat. Mais pire encore, certains vendeurs ne mentionnent MEME PAS cette condition avant que vous ayez signé sur leur tablette ou leur téléphone – et ils ne vous montrent pas clairement ce que vous signez.

Ils prétendent être une entreprise locale qui débute, mais c’est faux. Ils ont déjà sorti en vedette sur Radio-Canada dans un article : ""Viande livrée, facture salée"". On apprend qu’ils promettent de la viande de qualité supérieure sans aller à l’épicerie, mais des clients se sont plaints de frais de manutention exorbitants et de prix bien plus élevés que chez un boucher normal. Je vous reccomende aller voir l'article si vous avez l'opportunité.

Et ce n’est pas tout : leurs avis Google sont suspects, probablement truqués pour cacher les mauvaises expériences. Méfiez-vous bien de leurs ""offres trop belles pour être vraies"".... Si vous les croisez ou qu’ils vous contactent, dites-leur NON à moins que vous avez pas de probleme à  payer 2x-3x le prix pour la viande!

Quelqu’un d’autre a eu une expérience avec eux à Laval ou ailleurs ? Je sais qu'ils utilisent des comptes pour dire\* que tout est OK mais ce n'est pas vrai. J'ai vu sur Reddit des bons de commande avec leur prix, et meme des messages avec des accusations de ""diffamation"" quand les personnes donnent leur avis.",2025-03-26T14:42:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/1jkj7cc/attention_à_la_famille_québec_alimentation/,

- L'admin qui joue la carte du silence, ou qui prend trop de temps avant d'intervenir (ex dégâts d'eau).  
- Chiens qui courent dans les corridors sans maître et laisse, ce qui fait peur aux autres locataires  
- Plusieurs vols de colis et de vélos, et bien que l'admin ne prend aucune responsabilité, elle refuse d’aider en consultant les caméras de sécurité  
- Problème de gestion d'ordures. Chutes à déchets bloquées, accumulation de déchets dans la salle des déchets, et odeurs dans le corridor et même les ascenseurs  
- Problème avec le chauffage, au point que de la givre se forme sur le bord des fenêtres  
- Isolation décevante. On entend le ballon de basket du 9e, et même que l'on ressent ses vibrations. On entend les chiens japper.   
- Internet à basse vitesse et qui lâche.  
- Gardiens de sécurités pas assez présents, ou bien très désagréables.  
- Stationnement très cher, et traffic infernal lors des événements à la place Bell.  
- Côté sud trop venteux au point de ne pas pouvoir (physiquement) ouvrir la fenêtre.  
- Salle de gym avec peu d'équipement  
- Sentiment de plusieurs de se faire flouer. Les locataires paient un loyer très élevé qui comprend plusieurs services (internet, gym, espaces communs, climatisation) qui ne répondent pas aux attentes. 

Je ne peux pas confirmer si c'est vrai ou pas, je ne vis pas là. Je ne fais que rapporter ce que j'ai lu sur Facebook et Google map. Je n'arrive pas à trouver d'autres évaluations.   
  
L'EM n'a que deux ans, et a été inauguré en juin 2024. Il y aurait eu une amélioration et des ajustements depuis l'ouverture. Par contre, il y a des commentaires récents qui rapportent les mêmes problématiques qu'il y a deux ans.

Ça a le potentiel de semer la confusion sur le bulletin de vote, ça.

Cette semaine était censée être une semaine multiculturelle pour célébrer les différentes cultures présentes à l'école.

Eh bien... Ce n'était pas suffisant pour l'une des cultures.

Lundi, c'était l'Europe. Pas de problème.
Mardi, c'était la culture latine. Ils ont organisé une grande fête dansante et je n'ai entendu que des choses extraordinaires à ce sujet.

Mercredi. C'est là que les choses ont dérapé et je ne sais pas pourquoi l'école essaie de cacher les détails.

Les étudiants de cette culture ont été expulsés de leur salle de fête et se sont rassemblés devant l'école. Ils crachaient en direction du drapeau québécois. Il s'agit de plus de 100 étudiants. Un élève a été renversé par une voiture et hospitalisé. Selon certaines informations, certains élèves portaient des armes.

Qu'est-ce qui se passe ici ?

Jeudi. Même chose. Cette fois, l'un des élèves avait un pistolet lance-flammes et le tirait en l'air.

Comment se fait-il qu'il n'y ait pas plus d'informations à ce sujet ?

# Intitulé de la cause :

Action collective contre les prix prédateurs et les contrats illégaux de Qualinet

# No de dossier de la Cour supérieure du Québec :

500-06-001337-241

# Cette affaire concerne :

Cette action collective vise à faire cesser la façon dont le Groupe Qualinet inc. (ci-après « Qualinet ») profite de personnes en situation de vulnérabilité et de désespoir et à obtenir une compensation financière pour les victimes des pratiques illégales et abusives de Qualinet.

Le demandeur allègue que Qualinet est un commerçant itinérant qui a effectué des travaux à son duplex en violation des règles régissant les contrats conclus par les commerçants itinérants. En particulier, l’article 58(g) de la Loi sur la protection du consommateur (« LPC ») stipule que le commerçant doit fournir par écrit et à l’avance le montant total que le consommateur doit payer en vertu du contrat, ce que Qualinet ne fait systématiquement pas. En outre, le demandeur allègue que Qualinet a facturé des frais « d’administration » illégaux (10 %) et des frais de « profit » (allant de 5 % à 8 % en plus) en violation de la LPC et de la Loi sur la concurrence, car il s’agit de frais obligatoires qui ne peuvent pas être affichés de manière fragmentée. Le demandeur allègue également que Qualinet lui a facturé des items qui n’ont jamais été énumérés dans le document de « tarification » qu’elle lui a fait signer, en violation de l’article 12 LPC. Enfin, le demandeur allègue que le taux d’intérêt imposé par Qualinet de 2 % par mois est illégal car il ne respecte pas la Loi sur l’intérêt.

# Groupe proposé :

Toutes les personnes physiques et morales qui ont contracté avec Qualinet et qui ont reçu une facture de Qualinet datée du 7 octobre 2021 ou après.

# Réparations demandées :

L’objectif principal de cette action collective est d’obtenir une ordonnance de la Cour déclarant la nullité de tous les contrats de Qualinet conclus pendant la période du recours, et d’obtenir ensuite le remboursement de toutes les sommes perçues par Qualinet en violation de la loi. Cette action collective vise également à obtenir, notamment :

a) le remboursement des montants pour les items dont les coûts n’étaient pas indiqués dans le contrat Qualinet;  
b) les frais obligatoires que Qualinet affichait de manière fragmentée dans le contrat (c.-à-d. les frais d’administration de 10 % et les frais de profit de 5 % à 8 % en plus) qui étaient imposés sur tous les montants facturés à chaque contrat; et  
c) des dommages punitifs d’un montant de 1000 $ par membre du groupe.

René-Laennec, puis sur le boulevard des laurentides en direction Sud et essaie de le suivre, mais la personne conduit rapidement et dangereusement, et finit par s'enfuir. Elle m'appelle complètement sous le choc, en pleurant à chaudes larmes. Plus de peur que de mal, mais ça aurait pu être pire. Tout est arrivé si vite qu'elle ne se souvient de rien, sauf que le véhicule semblait blanc, et peut être une sedan. La sûreté du Québec va la contacter pour remplir un formulaire de hit and run - mais pas grand espoir d'attraper le/la coupable.

Est-ce que quelqu'un d'entre vous aurait-vu quelque chose, a une caméra de voiture qui aurait capté l'incident, ou aurait un voisin avec une voiture blanche amochée dans le coin droit en avant j'imagine? Un accident, ça arrive, mais frapper quelqu'un d'aussi innocent comme ça et s'enfuir, c'est fucking lâche, et pardonnez mon langage, mais je lui souhaite toute l'estie de marde possible et inimaginable.

1fgwfyu,La catastrophe à l'Espace Montmorency Laval gérer par Cogir,Then-Start3536,Discussion,27,0.94,14,"Après être tombé sur Reddit et une publication intitulée ""\[https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/1fbq4ic/mais\_questce\_qui\_se\_passe\_à\_lespace\_montmorency/\](https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/1fbq4ic/mais\_questce\_qui\_se\_passe\_à\_lespace\_montmorency/)"" en cherchant une direction supérieure chez Cogir, autre que celle d'Espace Montmorency, je n'ai toujours pas trouvé l'information. Si jamais quelqu'un la possède, elle serait grandement appréciée.

De plus, j'aimerais partager mon histoire afin de savoir si d'autres personnes ont vécu des situations similaires ou toute autre situation désagréable.

J'ai vécu une expérience extrêmement frustrante avec l'administration et la direction d'Espace Montmorency. À l'origine, j'étais locataire avec le Groupe Sélection et j'ai eu de sérieux problèmes avec des odeurs persistantes dans mon ancien appartement. Ces problèmes ont duré des mois avant que je ne reçoive finalement de l'assistance. J'ai également subi un dégât d'eau dans l'appartement, ainsi que d'autres problèmes. La seule raison pour laquelle j'ai décidé de rester et de changer de logement, c'est parce qu'on m'avait assuré que la situation s'améliorerait avec l'arrivée de Cogir.

Malheureusement, les choses n'ont pas évolué comme je l'espérais. De plus, lorsque nous avons voulu faire une cession de bail pour le 1er août 2024, tout s'est compliqué. Dès le début, le dossier a été mal géré : on nous a donné des informations erronées, il y a eu des changements constants, et l'administration semblait tout faire pour saboter le processus.

Le pire, c'est que nous avons été poursuivis pour une résiliation de bail, une expulsion et un loyer impayé pour le 1er juillet 2024. Ce qui est insensé, c'est que j'avais déjà réglé ce loyer le 5 juillet directement avec l'administration, dans leurs bureaux. Ce jour-là, on m'a même demandé d'envoyer un courriel pour confirmer le paiement, ce que j'ai fait.

Le 23 juillet, j'ai contacté la directrice d'Espace Montmorency parce que nous avions reçu une lettre d'avis final de paiement avec menace d'expulsion. Je lui ai expliqué que j'avais déjà payé et je lui ai envoyé à nouveau la preuve de paiement, ainsi que le numéro de référence. Elle m'a assuré qu'elle allait vérifier de son côté, mais je n'ai jamais eu de retour.

À mon retour de voyage, j'ai trouvé une lettre d'audience m'attendant pour non-paiement du loyer (celui de juillet). J'ai contacté l'administration à de nombreuses reprises, mais personne ne m'a donné de réponse claire. Après plusieurs semaines de silence, nous avons dû nous rendre en cour. Là, en quelques minutes, l'avocate a retrouvé le paiement. Il s'est avéré que l'administration m'avait donné un numéro de référence appartenant à un ancien locataire, et que l'argent avait été déposé sur son compte.

De juillet à septembre, ni la direction, ni l'administration, ni la comptabilité n'ont résolu cette situation extrêmement stressante, et nous avons dû assister à cette audience pour clarifier les choses. Lors de l'audience, j'ai expliqué à la juge que je voulais tout de même résilier le bail, mais l'avocate de Cogir n'avait pas l'autorité pour prendre cette décision.

De plus, nous avions également effectué un dépôt de 500 $ avec le Groupe Sélection lors de l'acquisition du logement, et nous n'avons jamais revu la couleur de cet argent.

Y a-t-il déjà eu un recours collectif contre eux, ou un qui est en cours ? 

**The Catastrophe at Espace Montmorency Laval Managed by Cogir**

After coming across a Reddit post titled ""[https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/1fbq4ic/mais\_questce\_qui\_se\_passe\_à\_lespace\_montmorency/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/1fbq4ic/mais_questce_qui_se_passe_%C3%A0_lespace_montmorency/)"" while searching for a higher management contact at Cogir, other than the one at Espace Montmorency, I still haven't found the information. If anyone has it, it would be greatly appreciated.

Additionally, I would like to share my story to see if others have experienced similar situations or any other unpleasant circumstances.

I had an extremely frustrating experience with the administration and management at Espace Montmorency. Initially, I was a tenant with Groupe Sélection and experienced serious problems with persistent odors in my previous apartment. These issues lasted for months before I finally received assistance. I also suffered water damage in the apartment, along with other problems. The only reason I decided to stay and move to another apartment was that I was assured things would improve with the arrival of Cogir.

Unfortunately, things did not improve as I had hoped. Moreover, when we tried to transfer the lease for August 1, 2024, everything became complicated. From the start, the case was mismanaged: we were given incorrect information, there were constant changes, and the administration seemed to do everything possible to sabotage the process.

The worst part was that we were sued for lease termination, eviction, and unpaid rent for July 1, 2024. What’s crazy is that I had already paid the rent on July 5 directly with the administration in their offices. That same day, I was even asked to send an email to confirm the payment, which I did.

On July 23, I contacted the director of Espace Montmorency because we had received a final payment notice with a threat of eviction. I explained that I had already paid and sent the proof of payment again, along with the reference number. She assured me that she would verify it on her end, but I never received any feedback.

When I returned from my trip, I found a court hearing letter waiting for me due to non-payment of rent (for July). I contacted the administration multiple times, but no one provided a clear answer. After weeks of silence, we had to appear in court. There, in just a few minutes, the lawyer found the payment. It turned out that the administration had given me a reference number belonging to a previous tenant, and the money had been credited to their account.

From July to September, neither the management, the administration, nor the accounting department resolved this extremely stressful situation, and we had to attend the hearing to clarify the matter. During the hearing, I explained to the judge that I still wanted to terminate the lease, but Cogir's lawyer did not have the authority to make that decision.

Additionally, we had also made a $500 deposit with Groupe Sélection when acquiring the apartment, and we have never seen that money again.

Je mène une étude de marché pour évaluer la faisabilité d’ouvrir un café gaming à Laval, et j’aimerais recueillir vos avis et suggestions. Le concept serait un espace dédié aux jeux vidéos sur PC, console et VR, avec un service de restauration (bouffe et boissons). J’aimerais organiser aussi des tournois esports et diffuserais des événement esports. 

Pour m’aider dans cette démarche, pourriez-vous répondre aux questions suivantes: 

1. Pensez-vous qu’il une demande de café gaming à Laval? Pourquoi?

2. Quelles caractéristiques ou commodités seraient essentielles pour vous dans un café gaming (par exemple, type de jeux, conforts des sièges, etc.)?

3. Connaissez-vous déjà des café gaming existants à Laval ou dans les environs? Si oui, comment se portent-ils?

4. Avez-vous d’autres idées ou suggestions qui pourraient améliorer le concept ou le rendre plus attrayants? 

Votre avis est précieux et m’aidera énormément à évaluer ce projet. Merci d’avance pour votre participation!

Dans le cadre de cette initiative, les propriétaires de résidences situées dans le quadrilatère délimité par le boulevard Curé-Labelle à l’ouest, le boulevard Renaissance au nord, le boulevard Le Corbusier à l’est et le boulevard Dagenais au sud, auront l’occasion d’obtenir un arbre pour la modique somme de 50$. Cela inclut le matériel nécessaire à la plantation (terre, compost, mycorhize, paillis et tuteur), la livraison et la plantation de l’arbre, de même qu’un guide pour l’arrosage.
Les citoyens pourront choisir parmi 16 différentes variétés d’arbres, afin de trouver leur arbre préféré, mais surtout le mieux adapté à leur espace. 

C’est grâce à la confiance et au soutien financier d’élu(e)s et d’entreprises, comme Christopher Skeete - Député de Sainte-Rose, Claude Larochelle, conseiller municipal de Fabreville, M&G Construction Restauration, Urbano Patio, Fleuriste Foliole et la clinique des yeux de Laval qui croient en la mission de PlantAction et qui s’impliquent concrètement dans leur communauté que nous sommes en mesure de réaliser nos projets de verdissement. 

Les citoyens de Champfleury sont invités à s’inscrire en ligne le plus rapidement possible, car la quantité de végétaux disponibles est limitée.

This morning, I come out of my house at around 12:47 (takes me about 3 minutes to get to the stop), and as I'm walking to the stop, I see the bus go by. I double-check google maps and it said the bus is supposed to come at 12:58pm, and still says the bus hasn't come yet, even thought it literally passed me.W hat's even worse is the fact that I was across the street, I LITERALLY WHISTLED WITH 2 FINGERS as I was about to cross the street.   
The driver looks at me, then drives away.

Honestly, this isn't the first time this has happened. As I said, I come to the stop 10 minutes early, but just the other morning **(bear in mind this was ALL Monday-Friday),** the bus arrived 20 MINUTES LATE.

Personnellement, je pense qu’il serait important de choisir un lieu où il existe déjà un grand affluence de personne, et qui est facile d’accès via transport en commun ainsi que via véhicule automobile. Selon il est important de pas faire l’erreur comme avec le métro Montmorency et d’avoir assez de parking pour un nombre important de véhicules. Idéalement selon moi, la gare se situe à la station Montmorency, mais il devrait faire une immense extension du parking extérieur à la fois publique et privée.

If you ordered today from a&w Laval (the one close to montmorency station) and your Uber eats waited more than 30 min to pick up the order,  just note that there were  only 3 employees at the restaurant (the one I think is the manager and two other people) the restaurant had a line inside, in the drive-thru, , the Uber eats guy, the Uber eats app ringing non-stop for more orders and they were rushing their lives trying to full fill the orders, yet all the time they were very nice with the customers. 

I understand all of us were hungry and wanted a&w at the same time and the Uber was getting impatient and stressed (which I understand he waited for more than 30min) but don't blame him nor the a&w employees, they were really trying their best. 

I had worked in fast food and this rush times are the worst hahaha full of stress and impatient people, I felt bad for them :( let's try to be empathetic and nice with all people working in customer service, for the ones that have been there, we know how stressful and exhausting it is 😅 specially fast food.

Pour ceux que ça intéresse, la ville donne des semences d'asclépiades et de plantes indigènes. Vous devez choisir un des deux types. 

Montrez votre amour envers les papillons et les insectes!!

&#x200B;

Page 19 du dernier Vivre à Laval:

Pour obtenir des semences d’asclépiade et  de plantes mellifères gratuites, par la poste,  écrivez à pollinisateurs@laval.ca. 

Jardin pour  pollinisateurs  

En choisissant d’aménager un coin jardin ou  un balcon avec des plantes qui produisent  beaucoup de nectar et aux couleurs qui attirent  les insectes, particulièrement les papillons, vous  pouvez facilement contribuer à la biodiversité,  en plus d’agrémenter votre paysage.  

Quelques idées pour créer une oasis de  biodiversité :  

• Installer des nichoirs et des mangeoires et  intégrer des points d’eau ; 

• Laisser pousser des fleurs sauvages, planter  des arbustes — les oiseaux et les insectes  hibernent et s’abritent dans les arbres fruitiers  et les conifères ;  

• Sélectionner des espèces qui fleurissent  d’avril à novembre — les papillons remarquent  surtout les mauves et les jaunes ;  

• Disposer les fleurs en petits massifs —  les insectes les trouveront facilement ; 

• Planter à partir de graines pour réduire les coûts.",2023-04-13T13:17:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Laval/comments/12kw9es/jardin_pour_pollinisateurs_semences_gratuites/,
